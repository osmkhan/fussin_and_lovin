I send them out with some thoughts. You listen, get your own thoughts, and reply-all (if the spirit moves you).\\n\\n\\nThese songs are all \\"country adjacent,\\" as classified/defined by me. Why?\\n1. They\'re good.\\n2. They\'re (often) overlooked\\n3. There\'s nuance.\\nElaborating on point 3: \\"country\\" is a divisive word, oft-leveraged and applied in bad faith. Labels can hide some shoddiness, but shouldn\'t. These songs stand on their own merit. Most don\'t even say much about cowboys \u2014 the ones that do deserve to. We\'re looking for substance, not box-checking.\\n\\n\\nConversely, some twang can work wonders. Don\'t fear the fiddle. Folk fans and rockers will find plenty to enjoy here. Goal #1 of the newsletter is to give me a platform; goal #2 is to expand some horizons.\\n\\n\\nImportant point: these are not ratings, rankings, or reviews. Every song is top-notch. I\'ll say more about the (lengthy) selection process later. But, this isn\'t a \\"best of\\" list, or a definitive sampler. It\'s just some stuff that I like. It\'s biased, which is honest.\\n\\n\\nWe\'ll elaborate on the philosophy as we go. Tell your friends to sign-up. Send me emails.

I\'m a sucker for a duet. I\'m a sucker for calling out a solo (\'Pick it for me, James!\'). Chiefly, I\'m a sucker for Emmylou Harris. Take note: she\'s going to keep showing up. We\'ve got pedal steel, right off the bat. We\'ve got fiddle. We\'ve got symbolism, saloons, and drugs. The bridge line (\'And the man on the radio won\'t leave me alone...\') lands just right. Listen to how the guitar follows that part. \\n\\n\\nSometimes, good songs have good advice. Every one of you ought to \'head west to grow up with the country\' if you haven\'t yet. Or, if you started west, head east. Head somewhere. Head down 20,000 roads. Head back to you (whoever you is).\\n\\n\\nTake this song as a template. It\'s first for a reason. This week\'s selections introduce us to the heavy-hitters and trend-setters \u2014 acts with the most entries in my list. Grievous Angel sets an arc. The finale song for the year will mirror this one in form and content.

Kudos to Eli and Elizabeth for spreading the word.\\n______________________________\\n\\n\\nSong #2: \\"Little Silver Heart\\"\\nWho Made it: Lucero\\nYear: 2001\\n_______________________________\\n\\n\\nThoughts: \\"Alt-country\\" in quotes means whatever it\'s referring to. Alt-country unquoted means this. Gruff and gritty. Crunchy guitars and loose twang. This song, probably more than any other, turned me on to this side of the genre. It\'s the 20th song I added to a monster playlist (now just shy of 8000) that I started back in 2018. About a year and a half ago, I decided to comb through and pick the best ones that fit under the \\"country\\" umbrella. I made a sweep and picked around 2000 candidates. They were all good, but I wanted to whittle down to something really good. It took a few more months until I worked the list down to ~600. Those got bounced back and forth through a few stages of probation until the cut hit 365. Those are the ones that I\'m sending out now\u2014locked in.\\n\\n\\nIf I didn\'t have Grievous Angel contingent narrative schemes, I probably would have made this song the opener. I like that the drums sound like a train, and even run out of steam toward the end. I like the way \'tired\' sounds the last time around, and I like that it would sound good in a bar. Nothing fancy going on with the lyrics, just a fella movin\' on. Simple fare, well-done.\\n\\n\\nLots of songs on this list have memories attached. I have good ones of hearing this song playing once in Hanover Strings while the dude there upsold me on a pedal, and of making a bunch of kids listen to this on a rafting trip. Now you can all have memories of me sending you songs on the internet...what a time to be alive.

Today it\'s Townes Van Zandt. I\'m not going for any sort of biography \u2014 click the link and read there if you\'re interested.  I\'ll recycle his own line: \'Oh what it all goes to show, it ain\'t my job to say.\' You don\'t need the details to appreciate the music. Songs like his cut close enough to the source that careful listening ought to tell you where he stood.\\n\\n\\nThe pendulum swings: if \\"Little Silver Heart\\" was trains and twang, \\"Why She\'s Acting This Way\\" is all kites and soft eyes. We\'ve got rich lyrics. If you\'ve wanted to chime in but haven\'t, here\'s a good opportunity: pick your favorite line and give your two cents. Who hasn\'t seen a \'sunflower smile\' or had \'bandana blues\'? Failing legs, cups of fire, calls to lovers.

Here, she\'s front and center.\\n\\n\\nThis one\'s for the heartbreakers (and the broken). It\'s bluesy. It\'s disillusioned. It\'s resentful! Osman made a good point yesterday about TVZ\'s evocative, nonsensical imagery. This one\'s more direct. No words minced in lines like these:\\n\\n\\nYour true love has made you feel better\\nBut look out for later\\nWhen she makes you feel worse\\n\\n\\nOuch! Straight to the point. Then, around the 1:33 mark, we get a 10/10 western kickstart. When the word \'said\' comes around in the first chorus, it\'s punchy and loaded. The bendy guitar echoes it right back. When I hear the title line (\'You\'re supposed to be feelin\' good. \'Cause everybody said you would\'), it feels like this scene from Hot Rod:\\n\\n\\nThe rug\'s pulled out. The safety-net\'s gone. The prophets lied. It\'s an anthem for the rose-tinters and nostalgics. Circumstance and feeling don\'t separate so easy \u2014supposed to is supposed to, but doesn\'t mean you will. Big stuff underwhelms. We make global claims from local data, deceived by the blues. Curse the curves and keep on truckin\'. Primes recur.\\n\\n\\nThe pedal-steel on this one adds some tasteful texture. Listen for it. Percussive harmonica in the verses? All sorts of unique sounds. It\'s a good headphones song, panning around. I\'d like someone who knows something about music production (Michael Schedin) to explain the first few measures to me.

It\'s a 90 minute barrage of cranked-amp canonizations and delicate self-assessment. They\'re on tour this year and playing the whole album straight through to kick off their shows. Snag tickets if you can. Send me a bootleg.\\n\\n\\nI\'m going to invoke my English minor authority here and say that there\'s some solid plot development packed into this five minute song. Three minutes, really, since guitar solos take a big slice. We get dropped right down in the ditch with the red-blooded narrator, his taken-for-granted belle, and the mad-as-hell deacon daddy.  The second verse introduces mama, sister, and brother, each with just enough backstory to make things interesting. They\'re gone as soon as they arrive, but they add some heft while the rest of the song fills out its allegory.\\n\\n\\nEconomy of words: \\"Zip City\\" is a title, a setting, and motivation for the plot. I looked it up: Zip City is a real town in Alabama (not just a euphemism), and it is a 26 mile drive from Colbert Heights:\\n\\n\\nThe \\"teenage freedom/open highway\\" story is nothing new, but DBT pull it off here, stuck on 26 miles of road, better than most. They know how to write:\\n\\n\\nI got 350 heads on a 305 engine\\nI get ten miles to the gallon\\nI ain\'t got no good intentions\\n\\n\\nThat\'s a cool line. No two-ways about it. I don\'t know what a \'350 head\' is (I drove a Honda Insight when I was 17), but I\'d get that tattooed on my quads any day. Some feelings transcend automotive literacy.\\n\\n\\n\u2013 Matt\\n\\n\\nReply from Sean Madden:\\n\\n\\nA great song with an excellent story. Country songs named after real small towns always have a place in my heart.\\n\\n\\nFor those who are interested in a more stripped down and dramatic version I would recommend The Live Version at Shoals Theater. Mike Cooley (One of the lead singers of the drive-by truckers) in this version emphasizes some of the more pivotal lines, including the one that ties the story together:\\n\\n\\n\'Cause he knows that blood red carpet at the Salem Church of Christ\\nAin\'t gonna ever see no wedding between me and you\\n\\n\\nContrary to Matt I think this story is just as much about being a teenage dirtbag, angry and manipulative, than it is a classic teenage freedom tale. There are no heroes in this tale, especially not the narrator. The song is based on Mike Cooley\'s early years, and at the end of the live version, Mike Cooley jokes, \\"and that\'s why I have bulletproof glass on my Minivan\\"\\n\\n\\nIn fact, if you are looking for an album loaded with sharp lyrics and southern tales, I\'d recommend the whole \\"Live at the Shoals Theater\\". A collection of the DBT\'s most personal songs, stripped down.\\n\\n\\nThe show is right where the Drive-By truckers formed and happens to sit right in the middle of the drive from Colbert Heights to Zip City.","artistWiki":"https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=1217798","albumWiki":"https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=1138017","relatedArtists":{"album":["Mike Cooley","Earl Hicks","Patterson Hood","Rob Malone","Brad Morgan","Kelly Hogan","Anne Richmond Boston","Jyl Freed","Amy Pike","Rodney Mills"],"other":["Patterson Hood","Mike Cooley","Brad Morgan","Rob Malone","Earl Hicks","Jyl Freed","Kelly Hogan","Amy Pike"]}},{"number":6,"song":"Telephone Road","artist":"Steve Earle","album":"El Corazon","spotifyLink":"https://open.spotify.com/track/1rjvVnu5bMrKKGKLTJOYrJ","textBody":"5-15-2024: Telephone Road\\n\\n\\nLet me paint a picture for the East-Coasters and Rocky Mountain contingent.

I liked this music before I ever thought I\'d land here\u2014I\'m sure it influenced my choice. Legend has it that Steve Earle moved to Houston to find his hero, Townes Van Zandt.

On the instrumental side, we\'ve got the bouncy kickdrum, some light chicka-chicka strumming, friendly bass, and a clean lead-electric that wanders in and out. It paints a pleasant picture. You could listen to \\"Rolling Along\\" on a warm drive, with your left hand out the window keeping beat.\\n\\n\\nIf you focus on the beat and the sun on your arm, it\'ll be a nice drive. Dig in a little, though, and you feel an edge.

Old Byrds fans didn\'t like it because it was too country. Country fans didn\'t like it because it didn\'t sound how country sounded before. I like it, though, as did a whole bunch of folks between now and then who worked it into their style. How\'d the album come to be? The Byrds had a good run of folk-rock records in the mid 60s (with some country inflections). Then, they hired Gram Parsons (the guy from song #1), who\'d been busy in the country-rock lab. He pushed his creative agenda, and Sweetheart is what came through. Not long after they finished the album, Parsons moved on to other projects (\\"creative differences\\"). \\n\\n\\nOther influences were afoot. \\"Nothing Was Delivered\\" is one of two Bob Dylan songs on Sweetheart, both from his Basement Tapes. I won\'t dive too much more into the history (because I don\'t know much more about it), but that ought to be enough to highlight the musical syzygy. Read more on wikipedia if you\'re curious.\\n\\n\\nOn to the song itself: a perfect pedal-steel intro kicks off. It\'s the most human, most emotive instrument out there, and a huge factor in making this genre so good. The first verse goes heavy on the country tones, and leaves room for pondering the Dylanisms \u2014 some sort of spiritual business deal gone bad? Take a stab at unpacking if you feel up to it.\\n\\n\\nThree acapella syllables, then the rhythm straightens out, the pedal backs down, and we\'re back to rockville. Bob\'s fog parts and we get three of the most clean-cut, memorable lines you could want:\\n\\n\\nNothing is better\\nNothing is best\\nTake care of yourself and get plenty of rest\\n\\n\\nYou can\'t hear that and not feel a little bit better. It\'s like a text from Mom after your first week of college. It makes this song into a great slump buster, a great track when you need to shake off a rut.

Today\'s pick won\'t put much wind in your sails, particularly compared to yesterday\'s high-octane chin-lifter. Everything in this song comes through in lo-fi sepia, dusty and earnest. It\'s good for dive-bar afternoons \u2014 the sort of tear-in-the-beer anthem you\'d want to hear in a place that still stocks the eponymous appliance.\\n\\n\\nWe catch some glints in the haze, like dust in that dive bar sun. There\'s a lazy pedal, the first mandolin we\'ve come across, and maybe even a couple steel drum hits. The song loops well with itself: I queued it up a few times in a row while I was shredding calc finals. The hypnotic effect stacks with sequential plays. I got a thousand yard stare around the 4th and had to pause to focus. Tests can\'t shred themselves.\\n\\n\\nClosing thought: I\'ve never heard any good vape inspired country songs.

We\'ll hear plenty of grizzled, pack-a-day voices this year, but today\'s ain\'t one. I thought about attaching some metrics to the songs on this list, scoring them on attributes like twang, grit, wallop, bounce, etc. I tabled that idea, but \\"Rock Me on the Water\\" would have scored high on scrunch*.\\n\\n\\nScrunch, in case it\'s not clear, means a song\'s tendency to make your face twist up. It\'s a feature that concentrates in particular notes and phrases. For me, those moments on \\"Rock Me\\" come in the first chorus (\'soothe my fevered brow\'), the third verse (\'Like Jesus in the sky,\' and the following slide fill), and in the outro chorus (\'The wind is with me now\'). Potent stuff!\\n\\n\\nThe Ronstadt pipes could stand on their own, but they don\'t have to. I like how the backing vocals add some body here: strategic \\"oooos\\" and \\"aaahhhhs\\" closing the verses, then tripled-up lines sticking close to the lead in the choruses. Allstars deserve support, and supporters deserve recognition.\\n\\n\\n\\"Rock me on the Water\\" is a Jackson Browne tune originally, from his debut album (which came out when he was 23, by the way). Jackson\'s version is great, but not country enough to make this list \u2014he\'ll get his day. Linda\'s take, though, hits the sweet spot. Her singing chops are strong enough to pull in the genre agnostics, and this track is a nice midpoint between twangy numbers like \\"Crazy Arms\\" and poppier fare. If you\'ve been on this fence, this might help knock you off on the right side.\\n\\n\\nJB\'s catalog features some memorable idealistic-outsider characters (see \\"The Pretender\\" and \\"For Everyman\\" **). Those songs came later, but we get a bit of that here:\\n\\n\\nThe road is filled with homeless souls\\nEvery woman child and man\\nWho have no idea where they will go\\nBut they\'ll help you if they can\\n\\n\\nThat\'s a nicely tempered, timidly optimistic outlook: no one has a clue, but we\'re in it together. As for practical wisdom, I like the line that comes next:\\n\\n\\nEveryone must have some thought\\nThat\'s gonna pull them through somehow\\n\\n\\nSeems a little weak typed out, but it lands when Linda belts it. Think about your thoughts: which one\'s your pull-through?\\n\\n\\n\u2013 Matt\\n\\n\\n* Illustrating with an example: one of the scrunchiest moments I know comes in JB\'s \\"Running on Empty\\".

He\'s a Texas fella, and I\'ll pay due diligence to my state of residence. He\'s also part of the three names club, which grants special status.\\n\\n\\nFrom his website, I\'d infer that REK claims \\"The Road Goes On Forever\\" as his trademark tune. That one didn\'t make my list. I prefer this variation on the classic road song: the trail song. Does the difference have much meaning? Probably not. He abandons \\"trail\\" and sings about a road anyway in the bridge, so maybe we shouldn\'t read too much in the difference. Still, some variety is nice, and I put sentimental stock in trails.\\n\\n\\nAs for song structure, \\"each verse gets an age, young to old\\" is a classic. I brought up \\"Running on Empty\\" yesterday, which does it. So does \\"100 Years,\\" to tear-jerking effect. In \\"Trail,\\" we get \'young boy\' to \'young man\' to \'own man,\' presumably the enlightened state that comes along many miles down the trail. It\'s simple; it makes sense; it works. Keen looks back, but the memories he shares aren\'t too specific or personal. Mostly, he leaves room for us to fill in the blanks with our own young boy/young man/own man reminiscences. We do half the work and get paid double.\\n\\n\\nI\'m not gonna pick apart lyrics here. What you hear is what you get. It\'s a tough song to categorize\u2014upbeat nostalgic, not quite poetic, honest. Straight shootin\'. For me, it\'s a two beer song: you want to hear it when you\'re a little loose, and willing to belt out some lines. It\'d do numbers at any good backyard barbecue. Does it have the heft and depth of \\"Why She\'s Acting This Way\\" or \\"Zip City\\"? No. Is it a perfect addition to your driving playlist when you leave the East Coast after seven years and go home? Yes\u2014it gave me a boost when I was schlepping across Iowa.

Today and tomorrow, we\'re listening to some deep-cuts. Remember: expanding horizons is goal #2. These are probably new for most folks. From what I can tell with some (minimal) research, neither of these groups ever \\"made it big.\\" We build a case that talent need not entail success \u2014 these slap.

It\'s a nice concept: they take down-and-out records and lift them up for a second chance. Numero aren\'t the only ones doing it: Casey Affleck starred in a movie a couple years ago about a successful reissue from Light In the Attic, and Paradise of Bachelors will be important for us sometime in the next few weeks. If you want to build your \\"niche musical interests\\" clout, check some of these out \u2014plenty of good stuff.\\n\\n\\n\\"Player\\" is today\'s good stuff. For better or for worse \u2014 and I\'d say for better \u2014you can tell this isn\'t coming from a top-end, prime-grade, high-polish studio. You can hear some crackle break the vocal edges, the bass doesn\'t go too deep, and all the sounds come straight down the line (sans fancy panning). Slick production can hide some hackery, but Jones gets no such privilege. \\"Player\\" has to fend for itself.\\n\\n\\nFend it does! Maybe thanks to underdog pluck, we get some bold moves: how many other songs can you name with three back-to-back guitar solos, each in a different style (acoustic to electric to pedal, all in quick succession, starting at 1:17)? Like \\"Grievous Angel\\", it\'s a not-quite-duet, with a Ronstadt-esque background vocalist pushing harmonies in key phrases. The bare-bones production frame doesn\'t leave much room between the layered guitars, which blend together into some multi-armed rhythm/lead/lick machine. I can\'t back this up with any facts, but I have a hunch that Jones might have played most of the parts himself then had them stacked together \u2014 it has that unified-mind, \\"one man band\\" feeling to it.\\n\\n\\nIn the lyrics department, it\'s clairvoyant. Jones knows that his skills might not pay the bills \u2014\'being good don\'t always make the bread\' \u2014 but stays committed to the path. Fate drives, and he\'s along for the ride. He observes the moment in mindful fashion \u2014 \'Player, do you like your cards?\' \u2014 and maintains faith in the draw. He has something good. Stay at the table long enough, and folks are bound to notice:\\n\\n\\nThey say that you\'re gonna win\\nWheel has turned but now it turns again\\n\\n\\nIt\'s a patient brand of optimism. Is an art label re-release what he expected for his work? Maybe not, but it seems in the spirit of the song. \\n\\n\\nTake note, hopeful small-timers: the story ain\'t over.\\n\\n\\n\u2013 Matt","artistWiki":"https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=2293657","albumWiki":"https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=73124752","relatedArtists":{"album":[],"other":["Mark Jones"]}},{"number":13,"song":"Carolinah","artist":"Ox","album":"Dust Bowl Revival","spotifyLink":"https://open.spotify.com/track/3Cj85JRHIjoTLiDOTjEPi6","textBody":"5-22-2024: Carolinah\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother day, another deep cut.

I\'ll be traveling for the next week, so some of the upcoming entries might run short. Not today\'s, though. I had a delayed flight, noise-blocker headphones, and time to dig in.\\n______________________________\\n\\n\\nSong #14: \\"Flatness\\"\\nWho Made it: Uncle Tupelo\\nYear: 1990\\n_______________________________\\n\\n\\nThoughts: A claim: as Sweetheart of the Rodeo marked the branching of the country-rock sound, so did No Depression for \\"modern alt-country.\\"  Definitions are tough: all I mean by \\"modern alt-country\\" here is \\"something that sounds like Uncle Tupelo.\\" You\'ll hear echoes in the hard edged grit-rock that followed through the 90s and 00s. The premier music journal in the genre borrowed the ND name. Uncle Tupelo is one of a few bands in the Jeff Tweedy/Jay Farrar nexus (Son Volt, Golden Smog, Wilco, etc). Cross-pollination makes for strong crops: all those bands feature on this list.\\n\\n\\nI went back and forth about which song to put first from Uncle Tupelo \u2014 maybe something lighter, more palatable. Shouldn\'t introductions be gentle? But, most of our songs this week have leaned light. We shouldn\'t ignore the heavy side. Where \\"Zip City\\" took hard southern influence, \\"Flatness\\" goes toward punk, near grunge. It\'s not just loud and thrashy: it\'s dissonant. The woozy, doubled vocals come through with a slight lag, a tick out of step. Farrar pounds the \\"wah wah wah wah\\" guitar between measures, keeping you on edge. If the noise were constant, it would be exhausting. But, with good discretion, the band leaves some windows: a few quiet measures, chances to catch your breath. Then, you\'re back underwater.\\n\\n\\n\\"Flatness\\" has pretty measures, but it\'s not a pretty song. It shouldn\'t be. It gets more done this way. When production overpowers a song, it pulls out the teeth. Sand down all the rough edges, and you\'re left with something too slippery to hold. A song needs some rawness, some ugliness to grab you. The balance is tricky: if you make something too raw, too ugly, then you lose your audience. You want it to catch in the gullet, not choke. \\"Flatness\\" hits the provocative sweet spot. If you let it, it sticks. It\'s a song that, for me, breaks through.\\n\\n\\nYou may not agree about \\"Flatness,\\" but take it as a starting point to consider what you consume: does it stimulate or suppress emotion? Does it nurture thoughts or snip them? There\'s danger on either side: fragility and numbness, exposure and ignorance. This all comes to focus in a song about alcohol, its use, and abuse. In moderation, drink opens the heart. In excess, it ends with the titular Flatness. It\'s an easy diversion when you can\'t stand what\'s real:\\n\\n\\nYou lie on that couch\\nTry to dream once more\\nBut your only goal is to sleep\\nUntil the news is over\\n\\n\\nRelevant lines. We all need escape; we all need \'something to get along.\' There will always be a bottle\u2014some, surely, better than others, but none harmless. If it shuts the world out, use caution. Keep some skin in the game. In that sense, I hear \'open up those curtains\' and \'drink up the daylight\' less as calls to \\"look on the brightside\\" and more as warnings to retain sensitivity. Don\'t retreat completely; don\'t lie flat. Lifting the last lines directly,\\n\\n\\nThere\'s darkness in this life\\nBut the brighter side we also may view\\n\\n\\n\u2013 Matt","artistWiki":"https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=425087","albumWiki":"https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=1530485","relatedArtists":{"album":["Jay Farrar","Mike Heidorn","Jeff Tweedy","Rich Gilbert","J.

Since I\'m tuckered from traveling, I wont say much: the bulk of today\'s entry goes to Zach. A few thoughts on \u201cShelly\'s Blues\u201d before handing off the mic:\\n* Pretty Much Your Standard Ranch Stash is in my top 10 favorite country album titles.\\n* Is it endearing? Is it gaslighting? I lean toward the first, but I\'m generous.\\n* Nesmith was born in Houston. More points for Texas.\\n* What are Shelly\'s other blues?\\n* Very bold to tell someone \'there\'s nothing so hard about the life that you\'ve lived\'. Don\'t assume, Mike.\\n* 1973 was the all-time best year for music.\\nWhether confident or compensating, Nesmith\'s swagger carries \\"Shelly.\\" A good rom-com would put this in a karaoke scene. It\'s catchier than most other songs about unrequitance, and perfect for strutting on stage. All in all, not bad for an industry plant.\\n\\n\\n\u2013 Matt\\n\\n\\n(Now for Zach\'s bit)\\n\\n\\n________________________________________________________\\n\\n\\nField Report from Zach: Waxahatchee In Boulder\\n\\n\\nFirst off, honored to be guest writing here. \\nKatie Crutchfield, a.k.a Waxahatchee, might be the first artist featured here who rose to fame in the current era, but her ability to fuss and love with a poetic twang serenaded my ears last night in Denver. (Also attended the concert with friends of the email chain Emma Miller and Leah Brams.)\\nAt approximately 9:08ish PM, Katie stormed the stage that featured three classic looking lightbulb outlined mirrors with a guitar in hand. The next 90 minutes featured the majority of the Tiger\u2019s Blood (released 2024) with some classic hits from St. Cloud (released 2020) and Cerulean Salt (released 2013). And her guitarist, Clay, had the swingiest hips that could only swing to the left. \\nIn my opinion, the power of seeing an artist with such poetic power as Waxahatchee live is to experience how she uses tempo, pauses, and her stage presence to emphasize 1-2 songs. Honestly, songs start to blend together in a live setting, but it\u2019s in those few songs where the tempo changes live and the audience fully focuses that an artist has power to ensure that the open eared folk can walk away with something special. One of those songs, to me at least, was \\"Oxbow.\\" \\n_____________________________\\nConcert Song #1:  \\"Oxbow\\"\\nWho Made it: Waxahatchee\\nYear: 2020\\n_______________________________\\n\\n\\nThoughts: For those who know me personally, I think you\u2019ve heard me talk about how 2024 has been a rollercoaster so far. The height of this was one February week where I got engaged, laid-off, and moved to Colorado. So when Katie put down her guitar, walked, and then sat down at the end of the stage in a big booming welcome of drums and then started belting out \\"Oxbow,\\" it really hit a nerve. \\n\\n\\n\\"Oxbow\\" is the opening song on St. Cloud, which Katie aims to set the story regarding sobriety and her new chapter in life. Comparing my 2024 start with sobriety is a tad trite, but the genre confusing sound provides a universality that I know everyone can connect to. Just take the lines:\\n\\n\\nWhat Dreams become concrete, may feel trite\\nMakes a dull mind.\\n\\n\\nI\u2019ve got dreams, and I hope everyone does too, for the next chapter. I just can\u2019t focus on what might actually come true versus not. Moreover, I don\u2019t even fully know what those dreams might be. I just agree with Katie that in my ignorance:\\n\\n\\nI want it all\\nI want it all\\nI want it all, oh \\n\\n\\nAgain, I don\u2019t know yet what all is. I have to hope and convey with a big band country sound all the big bright and beautiful possibilities that the future\u2019s \u201call\u201d might be. Guess that\u2019s just life in your 20s.  \\n\\n\\n\u2013 Zach\\n\\n\\nP.S.

Circumstance demanded brevity (I had to catch a few winks to make sure I could keep the Maz between the lines), but TVZ deserves better. Now that I\'m rental-free and bus-bound, I can take another shot. That\'s item #1.\\n\\n\\nBut, another song has a spot on the docket today: the great \\"Anniversary Song\\" from Cowboy Junkies. Lucky for us, they make a good pair: one\'s about a woman to love (and the way that she loves), and the other takes on love itself (without much focus on characters). Here\'s a chance for some side-by-side listening and co-enrichment. No fussin\' today \u2014 all lovin\'. Dial in.\\n\\n\\nIn the last email, I tagged \\"Loretta\\" with the phrase \\"portrait of an ideal.\\" To expand on that: after the windblown intro, TVZ introduces his \'barroom girl\' and lists her winning traits. So winning, probably, that they verge on \\"too good to be true\\" \u2014 a lie we\'d love to believe:\\n\\n\\nHer age is always 22\\nHer laughing eyes a hazel hue\\nSpends my money like water falls\\nLoves me like I want her to\\n\\n\\nWith all that description, Loretta herself is elusive. She\'s less of a drinking-buddy-crush and more of a mythic muse.  We see the ideal, but the human part is hidden: \'She don\'t cry when I can\'t stay, least not \'til she\'s all alone\'. We imagine how she shines, but what does she do? We have the definition of Loretta, but no examples in context. I don\'t think the ghostly quality hurts the song, though. If anything, it\'s stronger for the gaps: the mystery intrigues. Should we want someone to love us the way we want them too? Think it over.\\n\\n\\nNow, listen to \\"Anniversary Song.\\" No one gets a name. No hazel eyes, no numbered sleeves, no diamond shine: there\'s open space where the beloved subject fits. We don\'t see a figure, but we see its shadow (meant without negative connotation) on everything around it. It\'s love made tangible:\\n\\n\\nHave you ever had the pleasure of watching\\nA quiet winter\'s snow slowly gathering\\nLike simple moments adding up?\\n\\n\\n\\"Anniversary\\" reminds me of something my algebraic geometry professor said. To paraphrase: \\"if you want to know what something is, you need to know how it relates to everything else.\\" He meant it in the context of scheme-autmorphims of projective space, but it holds here too. We don\'t know who made the Junkies feel so loving, but we know about rain-soaked purple, grapes on the wind, and a face that lights up just for you. We believe that, somehow, the beloved lives in all these scenes and outshines them:\\n\\n\\nWell I have known all these things\\nAnd the joys that they can bring\\nAnd I\'ll share them all for a cup of coffee\\nAnd to wear your ring\\n\\n\\nTake note, fianc\xe9(e)s: it\'s a wedding playlist ringer. \\n\\n\\nBoth songs build a model of love: incarnate in \\"Loretta,\\" projected in \\"Anniversary.\\" The first is form without function, the second reversed (Jack loves a good word-reversal). All effective roads pass through abstraction.

For example: \'You\'ve got nothing to fear about drinking a beer if you share it with the son of God.\' Add that to the list of lines that deserve a tattoo (or at least a prominent bumper sticker). Another gem: \'the Lord moves in mysterious ways and tonight, my son . . . he gonna use your car!\' \\n\\n\\nPoetry.

We have some fans on the list who were asking if we\'d hear his stuff, so it\'s good that we\'re starting. There\'ll be more down the line.\\n______________________________\\n\\n\\nSong #21: \\"Leave the City\\"\\nWho Made it: Magnolia Electric Co.\\nYear: 2005\\n_______________________________\\n\\n\\nThoughts: Tuesday, over steins of Kolsch, I had a talk with my buddy Andrew and his roommate Ewan about art you find at the right time. I mean Boyhood the summer before college, then The Graduate when you\'re back home, unemployed, four years later. I mean \\"Leave the City\\" when you leave the city*. That\'s me now: LaGuardia is gone, and Bush is coming up quick. I chose this song to cap my week of travel, anticipating Molina\'s moody heft. I expected a wallop and got just that. Now I\'m misty, way up high, taking the trumpet to heart. \\n\\n\\nIt fits. I\'ve talked before about the human sound of slidey-guitar, but brass outshines steel today. Try this live version too, where the trumpet gets more room to breathe. You hardly miss the pedal. When the trumpet takes a break, Molina picks up the slack. His first line is a real gutshot:\\n\\n\\n  It broke my heart to leave the city\\n  I mean it broke what wasn\'t broken in there already  \\n\\n\\nNo fat to cut. It\'s good that we got some levity from TA yesterday, because we won\'t find any here. You won\'t laugh, but you might crack a wistful smile. You listen; you feel; you think \u2014 our chief pursuits.\\n\\n\\nThe song gets me thinking about home and how it diffuses. Through 18 years on Sheridan Street, home was all right there. Then I moved around. I\'m pretty cavalier about the \\"curve-ball\\" philosophy I brought up a couple weeks ago, and mostly feel that it\'s done me right. Sometimes, though, you come unmoored. I remember feeling that way during my first year teaching: home was spread too thin. My family was in Wyoming, my thoughts still in New Hampshire, and my body in Maine. Each place had a claim, but none felt strong enough to cross the threshold \u2014 too much tonic, not enough gin. It\'s the sort of feeling I imagine I\'d share with Molina\'s North Star:\\n\\n\\n  Half my life spent on a highway\\n  Half my life I didn\'t choose\\n  And I have seen the North Star\\n  Shinin\' in the freight yards\\n  And I knew it was a hard time that it come through\\n  It\'s made him thankful for the blues\\n\\n\\nIt\'s a brutal song, but not a hopeless one. You can always find more \\"home\\". The North Star is a recurring character in Molina\'s songs, and he calls on it here as a sympathetic friend and alter-ego. Hearing that verse, forlorn as it may be, reminds me of one of my great blessings: I\'ve always been lucky with friends. I know folks all over who will host me on a moment\'s notice (as they did this past week). Many are folks I wouldn\'t know if I hadn\'t misplaced some sense of home along the way. In that way, relocation is a gift. I\'ve spread home around, but I haven\'t lost any of it. The bonds testify.\\n\\n\\nDrifting is natural \u2014 fight it. What breaks my heart?  It\'s the issue of living on a slope. Everything slides. If you want to keep something, you can\'t \\"set it and forget it.\\" I try to be intentional about little pushes uphill. Letters are good; visits are great; mass-emails are better than nothing. You do what you can. Why am I thankful for the blues? The blues keep me punching. Feeling down when you take off keeps you coming back.\\n\\n\\nIt\'s tough to see them go \u2014 good times and hard times both. We look forward, smile, and miss what\'s gone. You leave the city, then you go back. Never have enough.\\n\\n\\n\u2013 Matt\\n\\n\\n* \\"City\\" here for me means all over (not just Manhattan)\\n\\n\\nReply from Osman Khan:\\n\\n\\nFor those keeping score, we are now at a 19% DDDD rate (died-of-drink-drugs-or-\\ndepression) for the artists on this playlist. I\'ve got Gram Parsons, Gene and Michael Clark of the Byrds, TVZ, and now Molina, so 4 artists out of 21, let me know if I missed someone. \\n\\n\\nIn any case, heavenly bodies over the rail yard make an appearance elsewhere in Molina\'s output that year, though I won\'t shout out the song in case it comes up later in F&L. The moon polishing the rail is one of those all-time lines that\'s stuck with me ever since I heard it.\\n\\n\\nI caught this song headed out of manhattan myself, flying to Toronto for some visa shenanigans. I typed this out at Newark airport, listening to the gate attendant singing a pop song to herself and ruminating on all these lonely, lonely people\'s songs in Fussin\' and Lovin\'. Happy to hear the songs, happier still to not count myself among the truly miserable\'s number.

Listen closely after the first four strums, and you\'ll hear some ice in a glass. That\'s a nice bit of world-building for a bar song. But, it takes some time to get to the bar. The first verse wouldn\'t fit what the title prescribes. It sounds more like a nighttime drive, quiet and cautious. The moon follows your window and keeps calling.\\n\\n\\nThen, there\'s a little turn in the chorus. Spooky shifts to cozy: the destination is in sight. I don\'t know enough music theory to say if there\'s a key change or something like that, or if shifting the delivery a bit and sliding to the \\"happy\\" side gets it done. @Michael: please advise.\\n\\n\\nEither way, we get the feel. We\'re smiling in the bar for a few lines, then another layer drops in (some light percussion and an extra guitar) to kick us back out under the moon, a generation prior. The best line delivery in the song is in \'my daddy saw the moon and heard the sound of the strip\' from 1:38 to 1:45. Frontman Ryan Adams almost yodels the end of sound, then swallows strip down deep. Perfect. There\'s a lot of attention to detail in this song, and maybe a bit more production than we\'re used to, but I don\'t think it\'s overdone. It\'s smooth and substantial.\\n\\n\\nFinally, in the second chorus, we can dance. Two backup singers join in, the drums open up, and we forget the spooky moonlit verse for a while. It\'s simple: \'man I love the feeling when I go out, dancing with the women at the bar.\' Hell yeah. Who doesn\'t? \\n\\n\\nThe other line in the chorus, though, isn\'t as clean cut: \'always know my woman\'s close somewhere.\' What do you make of that? The happy sounds trail off at the end of the line \u2014maybe not a good thing. Escapism? Adultery? Knowing that every night ends? Adams joins the list of featured artists who have struggled with substance abuse and alcohol, which casts a pall on the bar scene. It\'s an oasis with many shadows.

I promised that their sound \u2014 \\"modern alt-country\\" \u2014 would show up again. Here it is, with a twist: Slobberbone. Tupelo formed in Illinois, Slobberbone in Texas. According to their website, Slobberbone played their first show in a beer shop parking lot in Denton in 1992 (prime-time Tupelo). From the parking lot to today, Slobberbone has split, rejoined, branched into solo runs, launched associated acts, and generally made some noise. Let\'s get to today\'s noise.\\n\\n\\n______________________________\\n\\n\\nSong #23: \\"Placemat Blues\\"\\nWho Made it: Slobberbone\\nYear: 2000\\n_______________________________\\n\\n\\nThoughts: \\"Placemat Blues\\" has the bold sounds you\'d expect from a band born in beer and exhaust. The outsiders yell loudest and rumble the walls. Alt-country has never been a particularly lucrative or popular genre, so its acts are well-situated to shout at the music industry. In \\"Placemat,\\" Slobberbone calls out the crooked table, laments the lack of honest seating, and wonders whether a little ass-kicking might straighten things out. It\'s a common theme among frustrated musicians: the tragedy of corporate overreach. Slobberbone aren\'t the first to say it, but it\'s always worth hearing. Particularly with country:\\n\\n\\nUsed to be nothing sweeter than the signals it could send\\nThe musical hand it could lend\\nCould be a lonely man\'s best friend\\n\\n\\nLike Osman pointed out, it\'s a genre full of troubled souls*. Hearing from them can be a real balm, \'a lonely man\'s best friend .\' Seven circles of bureaucracy blanch the potency.\\n\\n\\nDismal subject aside, it\'s a fun song. I had it cranked up on my drive to the grocery store yesterday. The horn line might make it one of few alt-country songs that skim the border with ska. We also get some subtle shots at contemporaneous acts:\\n\\n\\nI know what you say, you say you serve the youth\\nYou serve them Bizkits and Korn with a spoon\\nBut I think you just serve you\\n\\n\\nI\'ll admit: I missed the pun until I checked the official lyrics. I wonder what the folks of Slobberbone would say about the countryfication of Fred Durst**? \\n\\n\\n\\"Placemat\\" takes its job seriously, not itself. It opens and closes with some studio artifacts that keep things light: laughs to start, then a closing quip \u2014 \'this whole thing\'s just kinda...stupid.\' Self conscious outsiders: chew on that.\\n\\n\\n\u2013Matt\\n\\n\\n*Extra credit opportunity for the hyper-interested: listen to Terry Allen\'s radio play Pedal Steal. It makes a convincing case that pedal-steel players are the saddest of all musicians.\\n\\n\\n**Qualms aside, this clip goes hard.","artistWiki":"https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=1507573","albumWiki":"https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=1507573","relatedArtists":{"album":[],"other":[]}},{"number":24,"song":"Sleeping on Hold","artist":"Freakwater","album":"Feels Like the Third Time","spotifyLink":"https://open.spotify.com/track/1FQFDuoVL1ameABbmF4Y8X","textBody":"6-2-2024: Sleeping on Hold\\n\\n\\n______________________________\\n\\n\\nSong #24: \\"Sleeping on Hold\\"\\nWho Made it: Freakwater\\nYear: 1993\\n_______________________________\\n\\n\\nThoughts: Here\'s a good song for a drowsy Sunday.

Go watch it; it\'s worth two and a half minutes of your time, and hopefully keeps you from other emails while you listen. \\n\\n\\nLenderman may not be the most recognizable MJ of our time, but for a certain scruffy set of listeners he\'s been throwing elbows with hoopers and moonwalkers for years. His recent feature on Waxahatchee\'s sumptuous sunset of a song \\"Right Back To It\\" shot him up the indie heap, but Wax put him on the map about as much as Taylor did for Trav \u2014 anyone who gave a care already knew right where to find him. I fell for him as a solo artist with Boat Songs, which I played as the latest addition to my armada (a bashed-up aquamarine V-hull with a \'62 Johnson Seahorse packing ten ponies under the cowling) clattered away from a test drive and a cash sale. Sometimes on the nose is ok. \\n\\n\\nMJ is a master of the vignette and aficionado of songs under the two minute mark, so it\'s only right that \\"Under Control\\" should unseam you from the very start. The opening chords don\'t dither, nor does the first wavering verse; they let you know you\'re in for a doozy. More accurately, you were in for a doozy:\\n\\n\\nI\'ve always seen the corners\\nAnd still, I stubbed my toe\\nI can\'t say I didn\'t know\\n\\n\\nYou can map whatever you want onto this, but I think the lyrics fit best with a bad romantic entanglement. It\'s an aftermath song, less the chronicle of a crash and more gazing at the wreck while you politely tell your friend to fuck off and that you do, in fact, know that red don\'t mean go. The track is fuzzy but not fuzzed-out, clearer by a long shot than his status quo, all serving to focus attention and sever distractions. Don\'t mistranslate attention as a call to action, though. There\'s no sense girding yourself for what already happened. Just embrace the suck and feel the kick-in-the-nuts, stubbed-toe ache seep and spread. It\'s the sound of a blown tire and a rolled ankle or, as one commenter said, a vicodin and a few beers. I\'ll leave confirming that comparison as an exercise for the reader. \\n\\n\\nWhile \\"Under Control\\" stays far from that Chumbawamba brand of brash resistance that borders on denial, I don\'t hear it as fatalist either. It\'s an act of acceptance. Unlike Cool Hand Luke, MJ has the sense to acknowledge when he\'s been beat, and for me, that\'s where the power lies. Lenderman knows himself and can take his lumps \u2014 he hasn\'t skipped town for the gaudy false promises of a distant megalopolis, hasn\'t obfuscated any ugliness with concealer and rouge. He isn\'t looking for something that isn\'t there, inside or out. Lenderman is a jeans-skiing, once-a-week-shaving, WWE-watching, tar-heeled twenty-something more acquainted with High Life than the high life. Why would he look for anything else? \\n\\n\\nKnow thyself, and know when thy ass is grass. \\n\\n\\n\u2013 Jack","artistWiki":"https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=75039072","albumWiki":"https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=72447663","relatedArtists":{"album":["Xandy Chelmis","Alex Farrar","Colin Miller","Lewis Dahm","Andrew James","Jon Samuels","MJ Lenderman"],"other":[]}},{"number":26,"song":"Song for You","artist":"The Outlaws","album":"The Outlaws","spotifyLink":"https://open.spotify.com/track/3RsLZfhZVLDWPjuVAsReur","textBody":"6-4-2024: Song for You\\n\\n\\n______________________________\\n\\n\\nSong #26: \\"Song for You\\"\\nWho Made it: The Outlaws\\nYear: 1975\\n_______________________________\\n\\n\\nThoughts: It\'s a pushing day. \\"Song for You\\" strays a bit from our semi-established sound. Some would say it\'s not country. Maybe not, but it\'s adjacent (which, per email #1, is the qualifying criterion). Consider DBT: we took them, and they wrote Southern Rock Opera. Western inflected southern rock is what we get today. It takes the swampy, Skynyrd-esque, dueling guitars sound, then dries up the edges a bit. To build on the whole south-meets-east-meets-west-ness, take The Outlaws\' biggest chart hit: their cover of (Ghost) Riders in the Sky. That one\'s a bit too cinematic for my taste, but it gets the point across. Western steak, southern fried.\\n\\n\\nYou hear The Outlaws in our Tupelos, Slobberbones, Luceros, etc. We\'ll add other links in the chain as we go. The sound may differ, but lines in \\"Song for You\\" tread familiar ground from the \\"not quite happy but not rock bottom\\" side of F&L: vague romantic disillusionment, fatigue and frustration, communication breakdown. In the grand scheme of songs, this one\'s close to \\"Little Silver Heart,\\" both in sound and content. Relisten to \\"LSH.\\" Compare the drum intros, the guitar layers, and these sets of lyrics (first from \\"SFY\\" then \\"LSH\\"):\\n\\n\\nYes I been sayin\', all along I been playin\',\\nBut you can\'t hear my song.\\nI don\'t hear no lies, there\'s just love in your eyes,\\nOr am I seein\' this wrong?\\nI, I can\'t say anymore\\nI, I can\'t say anymore\\n\\n\\nvs\\n\\n\\nYou\'re too sweet to let go of,\\nBut I don\'t need to fall in love.\\nNow I\'m too tired to talk my way out of this one\\nIt\'s a losing game, I\'ve had enough.\\n\\n\\nVery tender, very similar \u2014 direct influence? Or, maybe there\'s a confounding variable: losing touch with your boo just gets the riff gears turnin\'.\\n\\n\\nAn aside for the mathematically minded subscribers: is the space of songs metrizable? I mean in the sense that \\"Song for You\\" feels very close to \\"Little Silver Heart.\\" A good metric would account for sound, subject, release date, geography, etc. I suspect you\'d run into trouble with the triangle inequality: song A very close to song B, song B very close to song C, but songs A and C somehow far apart.  Anyone have a good example of this? I\'d propose\\n\\n\\nA: \\"Under Control\\" (from yesterday)\\nB: \\"These Days\\" (Gregg Allman version)\\nC: \\"These Days\\" (Nico version)\\n\\n\\nA reminded me of B right away; B and C are close by merit of being the same song.

Both members get their own part. There\'s also an Angel Olsen solo version, but I like the variety we get here with Sturg in the mix. Whichever version you hear first, the other will probably sound strange. Take your pick. Both members do their own backing vocals for a few lines in the duet, which doesn\'t happen much in older songs. It\'s a nice touch, but hard to pull-off live.\\n\\n\\nSimpson and Olsen pack a lot of award-winning clout into one track. I listen to more Sturgill than I do Angel, but I only have a handful of his songs on this list. Why not more? My favorites of his are the Stu-Grass albums (Cuttin\' Grass Vols 1 and 2). Those are top-notch and deserve endless listens, but I made a hard choice not to include any bluegrass on the list. The grass world is too wide and worthy to share one year with the sound we\'re tackling here. Get your fix elsewhere.\\n\\n\\nWe\'ve been overdue for a happy song (which has been on my mind since Osman pointed out the DDDD statistics). \\"Big Time\\" ought to help us balance. Compare/contrast it with \\"Sleeping on Hold,\\" this week\'s other (much gloomier) waltz. Both start with light:\\n\\n\\nGood morning kisses, giving you all mine\\nPull back the curtains, show me the sunshine (\\"Big Time\\")\\n\\n\\nvs.\\n\\n\\nMoonlight shines through a window\\nBathed in TV blue like the night before (\\"Sleeping on Hold\\")\\n\\n\\nThe sense from \\"Sleeping\\" was of drifting, bit by bit, into dissatisfaction. It sat on an unhappy realization: I\'m not where I want to be. With \\"Big Time,\\" we flip that around. It, like \\"Sleeping,\\" looks at life\'s backstory. It isn\'t blind to the bad times; it doesn\'t pretend perfection. But, it lands somewhere wonderful, which makes the rest worth it:\\n\\n\\nAnd I\'m losing, I\'m losing, I\'ve left it behind\\nGuess I had to be losing to get here on time\\n\\n\\nThe vindicating, golden moments in the verses outweigh the losing in the past. Things line up just right to put the two lovers in the tall grass, talking with their eyes. It\'s what we hope the \\"Sleeping\\" protagonist will eventually find \u2014 not necessarily dreamy love, but the right place, the destined place, the best place.\\n\\n\\nSerendipity on my mind: I was talking to Kevin D about the same \\"Golden Moments\\" idea last week. I brought up Foucault\'s Pendulum, a favorite of mine, and the central scene of a boy playing his trumpet. Unbeknownst to him, it\'s the boy\'s crowning act, the reason for past and future \u2014 his \\"Fixed Point.\\" Worth a read. Without giving too much away, here\'s the big line:\\n\\n\\nYou spend a life seeking the Opportunity, without realizing the decisive moment, the moment that justifies birth and death, has already passed. It will not return, but it was \u2014full, dazzling, generous as every revelation.\\n\\n\\n\\"Big Time\\" puts that idea on more generous footing, allowing for multiple \\"Opportunities\\" \u2014 less cosmological, maybe, but no less-meaningful. That moment may not return, but another will come along. Pierce the sun with your trumpet; sip coffee with your honey. The cogs crank out some gems.\\n\\n\\n\u2013Matt\\n\\n\\nPS: Turns out, Sturgill just announced a new album this morning.

It\'s his favorite song that he wrote. With such high commendation, we expect something special. \\"Nowhere\\" delivers: note for note, word for word, you can\'t do more.

I bet not.\\n\\n\\nYou can measure a song by how it lingers when it\'s over. I listened to \\"Nowhere\\" about six times before bed last night, then a hundred times more in my dreams. It was in my head when I woke up and won\'t leave soon. I mentioned \\"scrunch\\" when we listened to \\"Rock Me on the Water,\\" talking about how a song can twist your face. \\"Nowhere\\" is scrunchy enough to get me when I\'m walking along singing to myself \u2014 no playback necessary. If the neighbors peeping out their windows wonder why the long-legged fella walking down Bissonnet looks like he\'s about to cry, it\'s because I\'m thinking about these lines:\\n\\n\\nWell, the wind had it\'s way with her hair\\nAnd the blues had a way with her smile\\nAnd she had a way of her own\\nJust like prisoners have a way with a file\\n\\n\\nThe live video linked above is probably closest to what Guy had in mind when he first wrote this song. He was a folk-song devotee and skeptical about recording with a full band. Still, I\'m a fan of the studio cut. We get Emmylou singing background (everyone\'s secret ingredient). We get the instrumental interlude from 1:47 to 2:04. We get the prettiest little piano flourishes (one two three) that stud \'the blues had a way with her smile.\' Guy could pull it off without them, but they\'re nice touches.\\n\\n\\nClosing thought. Explicitly, \\"Nowhere\\" is a road-song without a destination. \'She ain\'t goin\' nowhere, she\'s just leavin.\' It\'s not about where; it\'s about leavin\'. I might overdo the cross-referencing here, but I\'ll do it anyway: compare \\"Nowhere\\" to \\"Wide Open Spaces\\" (a certified, all-time hit). They do not feel the same (early morning desperation, sun-shining jubilation), but they\'re drinking from a shared stream. Another strand for the web: Natalie Maines (of The Chicks) is the daughter of Lloyd Maines, who played pedal-steel/lap-steel/dobro for Guy Clark, Terry Allen, Uncle Tupelo, JDG, and a whole bunch more. We\'re filling in the picture.

Read on to hear from him.\\n\\n\\n\u2013Matt\\n\\n\\n________________________________________________________\\n\\n\\nGuest Feature from LJ\\n______________________________\\n\\n\\nSong #29: \\"The Bullfighter\\"\\nWho Made it: Luke Bell\\nYear: 2016\\n_______________________________\\n\\n\\nThoughts: It appears the mental and physical strain of running a daily e-newsletter caught up to our fearless leader. As such, I\u2019ve been asked to pinch hit by writing up today\u2019s FnL. But fear not! I\u2019ll be sure to pepper in some trademark Radosevichian vernacular (already getting misty) and extraneous sports analogies (see above) so that everyone feels at home.\\n\\n\\nI begin today\u2019s FnL with a question: what do John Colter, Josh Allen, and Luke Bell all have in common? They put Wyoming on the map. The latter did so in the most important way, by proving that alt-country\u2019s brightest talents are just as likely to arise in Cody and Laramie as they are in Nashville and Austin. While this may be true (it probably isn\u2019t), Wyoming\u2019s lack of warm bodies to fill theaters and buy records ultimately sent Luke Bell south to make a name for himself. Thankfully for us he did just that. Tragically, though, he died in 2022 after suffering bipolar disorder and drug addiction. Another name added to the already too long DDDD list.\\n\\n\\nBefore I begin my analysis of \u201cBullfighter,\u201d I want to clarify that my ability to extract meaning from music and poetry is marginal at best, and certainly not on par (keep \u2018em rolling) with an Ivy League graduate with an English minor. As such, I immediately asked ChatGPT for a line-by-line analysis of \u201cBullfighter.\u201d Perhaps my prompt wasn\u2019t clear, because it instead decided to write and analyze its own version of the song whose lyrics (as far as I can tell) had, until that point, never existed in the history of humanity. While this new song is an undeniable masterpiece (\u201cI get up in the mornin\u2019, drink my coffee on the run // Workin\u2019 on the tractor with the radio on\u201d) I knew I would have to muster my own synthesis of today\u2019s song.\\n\\n\\nMany of the tracks on Bell\u2019s solitary and eponymous album tell stories about individuals, each grappling with a unique human sensation. \u201cBullfighter\u201d falls into this category, which in Bell\u2019s own words is a song \u201cabout a drunk, sad ego. There\u2019s this character who\u2019s telling this story about how brave he is, but he\u2019s challenging his friends and the world, and not happy. He\u2019s lonely.\u201d\\n\\n\\n  You can try to crucify me\\n  I don\u2019t care if you don\u2019t like me\\n  I tell you I\u2019ll be waiting in my golden cape\\n\\n\\nInterestingly, in \u201cBullfighter\u201d (and many of his other character-driven songs), Bell writes in the first person. Is this an artistic choice? A practical one? An insight into a troubled mind? I\u2019ll let the psychologists ponder that one.\\n\\n\\nMy final note, and perhaps it\u2019s one that other readers/listeners picked up on, is that there is some heavy double entendre closing out each verse.\\n\\n\\n  For I am the greatest bullfighter that ever dared the pen\\n  Yes, I am the greatest bullfighter that ever dared the pen\\n\\n\\nFarbeit from me to riddle out any potential meaning in these lines, but I have to think there is more than meets the eye considering they were written by a rancher kid (who probably dealt with at least one bull in a pen) turned musician (who presumably used a pen to write his music). I\u2019ve always been proud of myself for picking up on this potential double meaning.

We\'ve got another one coming up later this week. Good to hear some different takes. Shoot me a note if you want to claim a moment in the sun.\\n\\n\\nWe\'ve gone far enough into the year that some big names are cycling back through. We\'ll still hear from the little guys, but we\'re digging into the catalogs of the central cast. It\'s a \\"breadth and depth\\" approach \u2014 tall towers, wide bases. That\'s how to build.\\n\\n\\n______________________________\\n\\n\\nSong #30: \\"Ashes by Now\\"\\nWho Made it: Emmylou Harris\\nYear: 1981\\n_______________________________\\n\\n\\nThoughts: We\'ve had three tracks so far with Emmylou on backing vocals. Once you start listening, you\'ll hear her all over, and not just on country tracks. Ethan C mentioned that he first caught her on I\'m Wide Awake, It\'s Morning \u2014 see this post for a wayward Oberst fan getting set straight. For the Dylan heads out there, try \\"Black Diamond Bay.\\" Good stuff.\\n\\n\\nThe takeaway is clear: adding Harris boosts a track. But, she\'s no second fiddle. She gets the spotlight today. On \\"Ashes,\\" you\'ll hear her back herself, doubling the punch. It\'s originally a Rodney Crowell track, but I\'m not a Crowell fan. Maybe that\'s my hot take*. Emmylou\'s version feels more direct.\\n\\n\\nGet up and feel this song. Groove to it. I had it going yesterday while I worked through some chalk-board qual problems, and my shoulders were plenty loose. The muted strums get the motion going. Listen to what they do right after \'teaching me how, to lay low.\' Thucka-THUcka-thucka-THUcka. If you\'re not dead, your head\'s bobbin\'. The interlude opens the sound up, while Emmylou stays cool, riding the waves: \'The moments of pleasure never do last, they\'re gone like a suitcase full of your past.\' Big lyrics, but she holds the pipes back \u2014 power in restraint. Let the band get out in front. A long harmonica wheeze sounds the last alarm, then she lays it down big: \'Baby, I can\'t go through this again.\' She revs up, shifts gears, and tosses on another layer for good measure. Now we\'re in it.\\n\\n\\nThe fore voice stays low, the back goes high. The arrangement declares: she\'s hurt, but not done.  We hear the pain, we know it\'s there, but it doesn\'t take control. She should be ashes, but isn\'t. They\'re prescient lyrics for an artist with a career as long and successful as hers (coming up on 50 years). It takes spine, and luck, to stay in the game. We hear her strength. Considering the tragedy she\'d already seen, and all that was yet to come, her words cut sharp. \\n\\n\\nListen ten times.\\n\\n\\n\u2013Matt\\n\\n\\n*Addendum: now that I\'ve listened to the Crowell version a few times, it\'s pretty solid.

For consistency, I\'m trying not to use live tracks, which pushed me toward the studio version. But, this song has an important back story, and the live version from the 40 Watt Club gives the best introduction. You should listen to both. Ultimately, though, I didn\'t pick either of those. I went with this one from 2014. It\'s the version I liked back in 2018 when I first got into the Truckers. Along with \\"Little Silver Heart,\\" it\'s one of the handful of songs that started my alt-country kick. Six years later, it\'s still a favorite.\\n\\n\\nThe backstory in short: DBT frontman Patterson Hood wrote this song about Greg Smalley, a prolific performer in the Athens, GA music scene who died not long before DBT put out their first album. Take a few minutes to read this piece that Hood wrote about Smalley and his influence. These lines (Hood describing Smalley) are clipped from the article:\\nSome of his antics were silly and seemed ridiculous, except that Greg had only weeks to live. He was a true believer. His songs cooked under their seemingly funny surface to reveal the same ageless longings that have earmarked great rock \u2019n\u2019 roll songs since the beginning of the form.\\n...The point was the playing. The Rock. By that time, it was what he was living for. It was the point of his existence.\\n...Anyone else\u2019s awkward discomfort was not his concern. He had the meanness and a job to do. He didn\u2019t have time for that shit. He only had a little bit of time left and he had a lot he still wanted to do.\\n\\n\\nSince I can\'t do better than the man who wrote it, I won\'t spend time unpacking lyrics or dissecting the song. Instead, I want to say a little about what the song means for me and how it plays in my head.\\n\\n\\nI added \\"Bubba\\" to my catch-all playlist in the fall of 2018 \u2014 among my most interesting times. I was living in a tent behind The Rock. I ate many eggs. I started my first math project, and fell hard for a girl. I listened to lots of music. They were dense, formative months.\\n\\n\\nMy job that term was to drive around NH, replacing soap in cabins, staining woodsheds, pulling cinder-blocks out of lakes, and generally wasting other kids\' tuition money. Here\'s a picture Ethan Cook took when we were on the cinder-block job together:\\n\\n\\nSean and Kevin went out on some of those \\"work\\" trips too. Most were with Jacob C (not on the list). \\"Bubba\\" was a song I played when we were driving back and forth between jobs, criss-crossing New Hampshire. Other favorites from those days are \\"I\'m Goin\' Down\\" and \\"Everlong\\". They were the ones I\'d make everyone hear, the ones I owned. We all have those: songs you love forever due to when you first loved them. They stick in the brain-stem.\\n\\n\\nWhat made those songs fit that term so well? In a word, vitality. It\'s what \\"Bubba\\" has in spades: living, not dying. It\'s a skin-in-the-game, life-like-a-knife, get-after-it anthem. Ethan Cook told me that he listened to it last night, then went out and rode his bike a hundred miles this morning. It does that. It reminds you to get your money\'s worth, not to \'scrape on by.\' Make your days dense like Smalley, and you might wind up a hero. Can\'t beat that.\\n\\n\\n\u2013Matt","artistWiki":"https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=1217798","albumWiki":"https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=48827706","relatedArtists":{"album":["Patterson Hood","Mike Cooley","Brad Morgan","Matt Patton","Jay Gonzalez","Alan Williams"],"other":["Patterson Hood","Mike Cooley","Brad Morgan","Jay Gonzalez","Matt Patton"]}},{"number":32,"song":"Good Time Charlie\'s Got the Blues","artist":"Danny O\'Keefe","album":"Danny O\'Keefe","spotifyLink":"https://open.spotify.com/track/2AyQXjM2jyjIM3t8YavbME","textBody":"6-10-2024: Good Time Charlie\u2019s Got the Blues\\n\\n\\nOne month in the books.

The border traces the low-lying lakes and rivers, so the hills of New England and New York give way to horizontal planes, endless exurbs. The hills pick back up the further north you go in Canada, but for a moment, there you are at the crossing into that great country, feeling as though you\'re flatlining.\\n\\n\\nCheaper healthcare, thicker snow, kinder, fewer people and fewer opportunities. Smaller stomachs for risk and the gush of gasoline out grey ground render unnecessary all the breaking and craking, hustling and disrupting beloved of its hotter, crazier neighbor to the south.\\n\\n\\nNow, Ox (formerly on this email list for their groovy cruiser \\"Cair-o-linahhhhhh\\" (F+L #13)) started out west in Vancouver, but its star player, Mark Browning, ended up back in his hometown of Sudbury, Ontario, running a taco shop and a cafe \u2014 an apt postscript for a Canadian rocker. My Ontario-centric musings stand.\\n\\n\\nSo, we come to the songs: \\"Stolen Car\\" and, supplementarily, \\"Stolen Bike\\" by Ox. Imagine a stolen car not on the Boss\' Jersey Turnpike nor the smoldering West, but cruisin up through those Toronto flats or maybe up to Vancouver, a city statistically determined to be one of the most generic looking places in the West.\\n\\n\\nAnd yes, \\"Stolen Car\\" is a Springsteen tribute. Not only to his version of \\"Stolen Car,\\"  but also to 1978\'s \\"Racing in the Street.\\" Give that one a listen for the full experience.\\n\\n\\nMy evidence?\\n\\n\\nYes the title, but from the first bars I just felt it. A Boss melancholy with Canadian inflection: more nasality, less sturm und drang. This ain\'t a man burning a black streak down the highway, mile markers spinning and smoldering. This is a man barely melting the snow off his hood.\\n\\n\\nAnd, more conclusively, the opening line in \\"Stolen Bike\\" and some of the later ones:\\n__________\\n\\n\\nI went from Hollywood up to the Northeast states (Direct quote from RitS)\\n....\\nI did the stolen car, camaro, skateboards and credit cards\\n....\\nI got a pink cadillac so I painted her black and rode it till I blew out the gears\\n.....\\nI was a chrome-plated outlaw, a back alley king, running like Ontario trash.\\n__________\\n\\n\\nWith the Rosetta Stone of that opening line, it\'s easy to see a lot of the lines as Springsteen fare. There\'s plenty more hints in \\"Stolen Car\\" (American unions and Camaros galore) but I\'ll assume my thesis is accepted from here on out.\\n\\n\\nF+L\'s love for tangled cork-board webbing aside, these songs are gold. \\n\\n\\nBrowning pulls \\"Stolen Car\\" out of its slow rut a couple minutes in, tries his hand at a 3-minute version of a Springsteen style epic and pulls it off: a plaintive yell for a less hardy people. The bare piano and the crisp guitar strings quiet down... and then, ROCKIN AND A-ROLLANNN. Fantastic, bring in the rest of Ox, we\'re croonin\' till the wheels fall off.\\n\\n\\nRockin\' and a-rollin\'\\nBreakin\' down hard baby I got soul\\nIf you got the balls girl, we can go far\\nStolen car\\n\\n\\nIt\'s that rarest of things: a starry-eyed, respectful tribute with something all of its own to say  \u2014 not lyrically but tonally. And solidly one-ups Bruce\'s derisive comments to his homely girl in Thunder Road with the insane line: \'if you got the balls, gurl\'.\\n\\n\\n\\"Stolen Bike\\" completes the classic Springsteen two-hitter: \\"Thunder Road\\" and \\"The Promise,\\" or, on the album side, Born to Run and Darkness / Born in the USA and Nebraska. A dream with a maggot in it; return to it years later and find nothing but a picked-through skeleton. Miserable failure deserves a well-written epilogue.\\n\\n\\nIt\'s been years since he rode off with his girl in a Camaro. He\'s lost the appetite for keeping a shotgun seat, he\'s lost the dreams of the 70s. He\'s on the run alone now, and the cops are right behind. Ride on, ride on. He\'s definitely a little more heated and a lot more desperate.\\n\\n\\nThe American references give way, as he leaves behind the memories of Hollywood, cadillacs, his old poems and his girl, the last line establishes him as Ontario trash, and then off into the Great Grey of the last couple minutes. Nothing like a stolen bike, ah it has an allure. Not the losing everything, but the driving out right afterwards.\\n\\n\\nA little more cork-boarding for ya: Ox opened a good bit for Mr. Molina\'s Songs: Ohia (F+L #21) , and formed in the first place to redo some of Woody Guthrie\'s Dust Bowl Ballads, just as the Boss did.\\n\\n\\nAll right that\'s all I got. \\n\\n\\nTake it easy, but take it dude.\\n\\n\\n\u2013 Osman R.

Too much rock? Too much folk? Today, we bounce toward the center, about as far into the mainstream, radio-ready region as we\'ll go. A robust endeavor requires forays. We foray today with Dwight.\\n\\n\\nYoakam is a superstar. Guitars, Cadillacs, and hillbilly music led to Grammys, Stetson hats, and gold-plated records. Don\'t fault him for that. Success doesn\'t require talent, but it doesn\'t preclude it either. Chart the logic. Dwight kept his heart in the works, so he makes the list. Another mark for credibility: he did an \\"LSD\\" tour with Williams and Earle back in 2018.\\n\\n\\nWorth the trip. Pretty cool.\\n\\n\\n\\"Cincinnati\\" comes off his first album \u2014 one of the quieter, cozier tracks. It\'s a tidy, workhorse vignette. It tugs the heartstrings without swinging around any heavy rhetoric. In form, \\"Why She\'s Acting this Way\\" is to The Tree of Life as \\"South of Cincinnati\\" is to Days of Heaven. Remember: a string of visions is sometimes a story, but a story is always a story. \\n\\n\\nWe\'re all mathematicians here. We like a structure. We get an unrealized entailment in the chorus: \'if you ever ____ , then I\'ll ____ .\' Ignorant of the hypotheses, the wayward man never satisfies ____ , so remains in Chicago (bleak) with his gin-drowned-cigarette. He can\'t play the game if he doesn\'t know the rules. Ain\'t that a kicker? The man is sad because he\'s unhappy. The woman is sad because she won\'t try. We\'re sad because we know what\'s happening, and we know what would happen if either sucker took some action.

I mean energy that stops work, that sends you walking three miles for ham and tortillas just to stretch your legs. Energy unfocused; energy in full. What\'s to blame? Maybe it\'s the travelin\' jones. Maybe it\'s just yearnin\'. Either way, when that fuzzy energy hits, it\'s nice to have a song for company. Here\'s one for free.\\n\\n\\n_______________________________\\n\\n\\nSong #35: \\"Big Brown Eyes\\"\\nWho Made it: Old 97\'s\\nYear: 1997\\n_______________________________\\n\\n\\nThoughts:  Old 97\'s [sic] got started in Dallas in the 90s, adding momentum to the Tupelo alt-wave. In what could be a historical first, moving to Texas made me miss an Old 97\'s concert. They played the Gryphon Theatre in Laramie in April \u2014 the same place where I played Suzuki recitals back in the day (i.e. 2010). By all accounts, it was a good show, but I was a thousand miles too far south to catch it. So it goes.\\n\\n\\n\\"Big Brown Eyes\\" on Too Far to Care is an electro-boosted rendition of \\"Big Brown Eyes\\" from Wreck Your Life. I prefer the boosted version. It rollicks. To transition from yesterday, compare the first ten seconds of \\"Big Brown Eyes\\" to the first ten seconds of \\"Guitars, Cadillacs.\\" Hear what I mean? Telecasters \u2014 the guitars on lead \u2014 have that genre-defining, rubber-metal sound. If I made money off this, I\'d buy one.\\n\\n\\nOn \\"Eyes,\\" we get some of the noisiness, some of the energy that I mentioned above. The song scratches an itch: the itch you get when you need to do something, but can\'t quite figure out what. It\'s the buzzing itch of waiting for what you need and living through the meantime. It\'s energy you can\'t abide for long:\\n\\n\\nIf that phone don\'t ring one more time\\nI\'m gonna lose what\'s left of my mind\\n\\n\\nOn the studio version, Rhett & Co. retain their minds. The song gets loud, but doesn\'t boil over. For a thrashier take, try the 2:08 mark in this live clip from SXSW 1997. That\'s boiling over. It feels extra potent coming from a band that\'s not punk, a band that still has acoustic roots. It\'s like when the Avett Brothers start screaming \u2014 effectively incongruous. What gets the 97\'s screaming? Not love, in this case, but a crush \u2014 a point out of reach. It\'s a call away on a phone that never rings.

I\'ve got a big drive from Houston to NM tomorrow, then up to Laramie (via Boulder) after that. I\'ve got seven songs set, but I\'m playing distribution by ear. Some might go out late or get lumped together. The picks are (partially) geographically motivated, roughly aligned with my itinerary. It\'ll work out.\\n\\n\\n_______________________________\\n\\n\\nSong #36: \\"Omaha\\"\\nWho Made it: Waylon Jennings\\nYear: 1973\\n_______________________________\\n\\n\\nThoughts: Huge name here. I\'ll drive through Littlefield tomorrow, which has signs along the highway telling folks that they\'re passing WJ\'s hometown. I\'ll have my hands on the wheel when I go by, so here\'s a picture that I googled in advance:\\n\\n\\nThe time\'s right to hear a Waylon tune. Not to be too on-the-nose, though, we\'ll go with one about Nebraska \u2014 a state-wise bait and switch. \\n\\n\\n\\"Omaha\\" adds another sub-file to the road-song repository: songs of return. We\'ve heard plenty about leaving, about running away, about hitting the road to find a new life, a dream, a lover. . . do those plans always work? Probably not. That\'s the case for Waylon\'s narrator, a Nebraska boy who outgrew his britches and fled to Frisco:\\n\\n\\nOmaha, Nebraska wasn\'t good enough for me\\nAlways thought I was the roamin\' kind\\nWith a pocket full of dreams and my one shirt on my back\\nI left there looking for some things to find\\n\\n\\nThat last line \u2014 \'looking for some things to find\' \u2014 adds a nice shine to yesterday\'s ill-defined energy, i.e. purpose from seeking purpose. He leaves; he looks, but does he find those things to find? No, at least not on the coast. \\"Omaha\\" picks him up mid-retreat, headed east:\\n\\n\\nSo it\'s so long Califor-nee, reckon I\'ll be a movin\' on\\nI\'m leavin\' even if I have to crawl\\nI\'ve got some loose-ends layin\' \'round that I left undone\\nWaitin\' there for me in Omaha\\n\\n\\nWhat\'s best about \\"Omaha\\" is that it distinguishes between retreat and defeat. He\'s not cursing San Francisco or wishing he\'d never left home. The city didn\'t work, but it wasn\'t lost time. He tried, learned a few lessons, and got some free schooling \u2014 not a bad deal. Clear-headed and appreciative, he\'s happy to head home. It\'s a proud song, not a loser\'s lament. The fixing shows what wasn\'t broke.\\n\\n\\n\u2013Matt","artistWiki":"https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=39086","albumWiki":"https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=6994453","relatedArtists":{"album":["Waylon Jennings","Joe Allen","David Briggs","Andy McMahon","Tommy Williams","Don Brooks","Ralph Mooney","Marvin Chantry","Tompall Glaser","Ronny Light","Glen Spreen"],"other":["Waylon Jennings","Tompall Glaser"]}},{"number":37,"song":"Amarillo Highway (for Dave Hickey)","artist":"Terry Allen (and the Panhandle Mystery Band)","album":"Lubbock (on everything)","spotifyLink":"https://open.spotify.com/track/3LO6evXvbopPHiVG9AKax7","textBody":"6-15-2024: Amarillo Highway\\n\\n\\nLots of ground between Houston and White Rock.

If I\'m going to cook across West Texas, I want TA making me feel like a \'panhandlin\', man-handlin\', post holin\', high rollin\', Dust Bowlin\' daddy\' while I\'m at it. (Fair game to take that as a Tinder bio, by the way. I don\'t mind sharing). I didn\'t drive 87, but I made plenty of speed on 84. Similar spirit, and still good truckin\'.\\n\\n\\n\\"Amarillo Highway\\" is the opening track on TA\'s sophomore album: Lubbock (On Everything). The name fits. I listened through the album today while Hub City approached, surrounded, then receded. You should do the same, if you get the chance. Much to be said for music in situ. The album\'s full of oddballs and Allenisms, quirks and turns. I feel bad presenting \\"Amarillo Highway\\" alone. The Lubbock tracks aren\'t singles. Take this as an invitation to listen through the rest. No WTX experience necessary \u2014 I caught the bug when I was still in Maine.\\n\\n\\nVinyl snobbery disclaimer: skip this paragraph if you\'re averse. Playing records makes you appreciate the first notes of an album. It\'s the manual action. If you line it up right, you get a few seconds of quiet hiss to prime your ears before the show starts. The extra touch makes good starts great, which is the case here with Lubbock. Hiss, perfect strums, horse clop piano, then strings to make you swerve. That\'s how to do it. (Another perfect album opener on vinyl: Bobby D\'s \\"Like A Rolling Stone.\\" Hiss, then he shoots.)\\n\\n\\n\\"Amarillo Highway\\" is worth listening to with the words in front of you. Good writing. To start, Terry gives a little geography lesson/poker bit, listing towns around Lubbock. He closes the line with a double entendre for the drivers:\\n\\n\\nI\'m a high straight in Plainview\\nSide bet in Idalou\\nAnd a fresh deck in New Deal\\nYeah some call me high hand\\nAnd some call me low hand\\nBut I\'m holdin what I am\u2026The Wheel\\n\\n\\nClever fellow. Once he warms up, he takes a shot at country-posturing:\\n\\n\\nI don\'t wear no Stetson\\nBut I\'m willing to bet son\\nThat I\'m as big a Texan\\nAs you are\\n\\n\\nI like the rhymes, and that\'s as good a summary of the album\'s feel as any. Marches to the beat of its own drum, or (more literally) to Terry\'s stomping foot, which you can hear if you listen closely. I\'ll let you parse the rest of the lyrics yourself. Pick a favorite.\\n\\n\\nTo close out: here\'s a picture of Terry (Stetson-less, as claimed) with Nancy Reagan. They were discussing his federally funded public art installations. Note the belt buckle, the moustache, and the jeans. What a guy.\\n\\n\\nHe lives in Santa Fe now. I looked when I drove through (\\"never meet your heroes\\" aside), but no luck.

Within reason, less is often better \u2014 for possessions as for stimuli. I\'m no minimalist, but I was glad during last summer\'s move to fit all my stuff into one carload. Here\'s a picture of it, packed and ready to go, in my old Maine apartment:\\n\\n\\nI\'ve had the cactus in the top-left corner since the sixth grade, which earns it \\"prized-possession\\" status. It sat shotgun with me on the drive. Carting my sum holdings down the road, I wondered which I\'d keep and which I\'d eventually lose. Some, like the cactus and the alluring portrait, I mean to hold for the long haul. They\'re too unique, too memory-entwined to leave behind. It\'s a tradeoff: simplicity lost, comfort received. Strike a balance.\\n\\n\\nHow does \\"Shoestrings\\" fit in? It\'s from a band with a great name (Cowboy) and a spooky album cover. Since I couldn\'t find the lyrics anywhere online, I transcribed them. Some of you, like me, might like to read while you listen, so here they are:\\n\\n\\nI don\'t need no pictures for my pocket\\nI don\'t need no shoestrings for my shoes\\nI don\'t need no ashtray for my ashes\\nI don\'t need no blueprint for my blues\\n\\n\\nJust keep me honest\\nAnd keep me rollin\' on\\n\\n\\nI don\'t need no time for hesitation\\nI don\'t need no time to talk about\\nI don\'t see no answers in persuasion\\nJust let the patient work it out\\n\\n\\nJust keep me honest\\nAnd keep me rollin\' on\\n\\n\\nCowboy says: if you can do without, then do so. Shed your laces and misgivings alike. \\"Shoestrings\\" boils the good-life down to a two item chorus: \'Just keep me honest, and keep me rollin\' on\' \u2014 wise words, if tough to follow. The nomadic sentiment is familiar, but the monastic spin is new. It\'s a nice touchstone when greedy feelings creep in, and the no-nonsense lyrics keep it from feeling overwrought. \\n\\n\\nWe all need a bit more than truth-telling and hard-trucking to get by in practice, but the takeaways stand: hit the road; tell the truth; leave your junk behind.\\n\\n\\n\u2013Matt","artistWiki":"https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=167744","albumWiki":"https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=56614854","relatedArtists":{"album":["Scott Boyer","Tommy Talton","Bill Pillmore","George Clark","Pete Kowalke","Tom Wynn","Johnny Sandlin","Steve Smith","George Marino","Frank Fenter","B.T.

We heard \\"Nothing Was Delivered\\" from The Byrds a few weeks back. More will come. Nothing from The Dillards on the list, though \u2014 they\'re too grassy. Out of respect, I\'ll link to their cover of \\"I\'ve Just Seen a Face,\\" and give three reasons to check it out:\\n1. It\'s my favorite Beatles cover.\\n2. It\'s my favorite song under two minutes.\\n3. It sent me scrambling when I first heard it. (April, 2019)\\nSo, D&C both brought some firepower to the endeavor. What came from this super-duo? Two albums: \\"Through The Morning, Through The Night\\" shares its name with their second. Both are great. This song\'s a standout. It\'s not flashy \u2014 no blazing guitar solos or piercing high notes \u2014 but it\'s well-crafted. It reminds me of a handmade fly-rod, or Jesse\'s wooden box. The maker\'s care shines in the details. Listen to how the harmonies float in and out, swell and fade, and how Clark\'s voice breaks just a bit when he sings \'you were there by my side.\' Little burrs like that are relics of real emotion, signs of life in the waves. \\n\\n\\nReplay-value is essential in a quality song, and a chief criterion for inclusion on this list. I\'ve listened to these songs many times, and I don\'t get tired of them. With a shoddy piece, you hear it a few times and start to feel that it\'s hollow. Surface glimmer fades. Not so here \u2014repeated listening breaks the song in, makes it familiar, and draws you back. Songs, as we each know them, are stimuli and circumstance. We hit play and load the same files, but we build different webs around what we hear. Bad songs don\'t support much webbing; good songs demand it. My challenge when I write these emails is to figure out what\'s going on with my own web. I have strong feelings \u2014 why? A major strand in my web around \\"Through The Morning, Through The Night\\" connects to the second verse:\\n\\n\\nI dreamed just last night, you were there by my side\\nYour sweet loving tenderness\\nEasing my pride\\nBut then I awoke, dear, and found you\'re not there\\nIt was just my own memory of how much I care\\n\\n\\nEver have that happen? Ever have a dream that cuts back the fuzz and leaves you raw? D&C have. I have. You probably have too. \\"TTM, TTN\\" tugs that feeling back.

I finished the day in Boulder (shoutout to Zach and Emma for hosting), but the best bits are between White Rock and Villa Grove: NM-4 \u2192NM-502 \u2192 NM-30 \u2192 US-285 \u2192 CO-17 \u2192 US-285. My car\'s stereo had mostly given out the day before. Bluetooth and FM were kaput, but AM endured. I tuned to AM 540 KNMX, \\"Pura New Mexico,\\" and caught the Tejano Gold program. Reception held strong until going fuzzy on the stretch of 285 along Carson National Forest. The stereo was frozen \u2014 no switching stations \u2014 so I stuck with it. Here\'s a typical view on that stretch, courtesy of Google Street View:\\n\\n\\nStations cut in, cut out, and overlapped. I\'m no radio-scientist, but there also seemed to be some cloning and looping going on. The result was a mishmash of Southwesticana: comforting, disturbing, timeless and topical. One patch hit me with at least three over-layered Fox News anchors giving updates on Palestine while Tejano Gold floated in the background. Very Clockwork Orange. The moment felt surreal enough that I recorded a bit of audio-ephemera, which is the \\"NM_AM\\" file attached here. Give it a listen.\\n\\n\\nWhen the babbling got to be too much for me, the waves focused into a Taco Bell ad. Insane. If I could design a Terry Allen-esque installation piece, I\'d make it a replica RAV with 285 windows and the AM quilt troubling the speakers.\\n\\n\\nNext, Colorado.\\n\\n\\nCO-17 \u2014 through the San Luis Valley, between Alamosa and Villa Grove \u2014 is maybe the best road in America. It has UFO sites, weed farms, the Great Sand Dunes, and the alligator from Happy Gilmore. Can\'t ask for more than that. I recorded another AM clip along there when \\"Where the Streets Have No Name\\"  came on. No name, just numbers. That one (attached below) has video of the little astronaut that I keep on my dashboard. Not to get too Ricky Fitts-ish with the clips, but it feels relevant.\\n\\n\\nAll that\'s to say: I\'m not fixing the bluetooth. I have the first leg of my TX return coming up tomorrow. AM all the way. It\'s soft around the edges, which eases listening fatigue, and you get some local flavor. It\'s what my dad always played on roadtrips when I was a kid. I\'ll follow suit.\\n\\n\\nAccordingly, today\'s song is \\"Radio King.\\" Golden Smog (part of the Tupelo-verse) gets a lot done with a few guitars and a tambourine.

There\'s not much on the track to distract from the words: dew-frost piano, reflex guitar, and a bass that retreats. He keeps the melody plain and pretty, just a notch past spoken word. Rhymes are scant. It takes faith to put words out in the open like that  \u2014 faith in his writing, and in some audience that might hear it. Lest you think that he wrote this as retrospective, a distillation of his life\'s wisdom, check the date: 1971. TVZ was born in 1944, so wrote this when he was 27. Old soul indeed.\\n\\n\\nThen again, 27 years is a long time. Easy to forget that. You can\'t always understand how long you\'ve been alive, but you feel it sometimes  \u2014 usually during a 3am leak. TVZ reminds us in the first lines of \\"High, Low and In Between\\" that we\'ve lived some life, as has he:\\n\\n\\nI come from a long line\\nHigh and low and in between\\nSame as you\\nHills of golden\\nPiles of poison\\nTime\'s thrown me through\\n\\n\\nOn the block: high and low, gold and poison, Love and Squalor, etc. Don\'t forget between. A trivial anecdote: I ordered four tacos today and got two. A bum turn, but I rolled with it. Why protest: if I refuse bad luck, could I expect good? Better to load both sides than to leave the scale empty.\\n\\n\\nWhat\'s the tone? Mindful? Enlightened? Anti-nostalgic? He warns that \\"turnin\' round is to become confusion,\\" then hangs pictures on legacy \u2014 some back and forth with the high and low. The bass lands here:\\n\\n\\nWhat can you leave behind\\nWhen you\'re flyin\' lightning fast\\nAnd all alone?\\nOnly a trace, my friend,\\nSpirit of motion born\\nAnd direction grown.\\n\\n\\nIt\'s a lonely, urgent song: a last-chance, a confession, a sermon. Like \\"Why She\'s Acting This Way,\\" it packs in metaphors and imagery to sell the points. Reduction to parts obscures the scheme: frozen skies, stones that stand and shine, brothers in the soil. It\'s not an easy parse, but it works.

I haven\'t caught a live show, but I\'ve listened to Tiger\'s Blood a bunch since it came out three months ago. \\"Crowbar\\" is our most modern song. I had the list mostly set back in March but wanted to add this. I remember queueing it up five or six days in a row for my morning walk, listening hard, and thinking of \'stupid questions.\' What a way to start the day\\n\\n\\n\\"Crowbar\\" packs a lyrical punch on par with \\"High, Low and In Between\\" but has meatier accompaniment. It\'s a full-band sound: you could put this on at a dinner-party without making your guests feel weird. Thematically \u2014 again, compared to \\"HL&IB\\" \u2014 it\'s less spiritual and more personal. That might be what makes it (and the whole album) such a good walking soundtrack. It feels like company, like a buddy spilling guts. The outro aches for a hug.\\n\\n\\nToo many great lines to tackle. Crutchfield & Co nail the verse to chorus transitions. The switch lines (\'don\'t come looking for me\' and \'don\'t blame me\') get drummed up. The lead guitar plucks some tender notes. When the chorus lands, it lets out a sigh. I\'m a sucker for vocal texture, so \'bending\' hits hard.\\n\\n\\nCommunication breakdowns: some walls we choose (I\'d rather not ask it), some walls we don\'t (I said the same thing a hundred times). With that in mind, think about this description:\\n\\n\\nA paradox poetic\\nYou get choked up\\nReading the classics\\n\\n\\nI\'ll admit: I love to choke up. I choked up yesterday, reading a classic. I choked up today, listening to Waxahatchee. What\'s so great about choking? A choke-up, to me, is a sign of clarity. We\'re not usually too good at seeing ourselves \u2014 more walls. It can take a story (or a song) to let some light under the hood. To choke is to understand. Good writers surprise you with yourself, so \\"Crowbar\\" is good. That\'s that.\\n\\n\\n\u2013Matt","artistWiki":"https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=36010928","albumWiki":"https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=75767751","relatedArtists":{"album":["Katie Crutchfield","Brad Cook","Phil Cook","Spencer Tweedy","MJ Lenderman","Nick Bockrath","Natalia Chernitsky","Emily Lazar","Jerry Ordonez","Mario Ramirez"],"other":["Katie Crutchfield","Brad Cook"]}},{"number":49,"song":"Tom Ames\' Prayer","artist":"Steve Earle","album":"Train A Comin\'","spotifyLink":"https://open.spotify.com/track/6ECCop7GhRHFspkXZzm779","textBody":"6-27-2024: Tom Ames\u2019 Prayer\\n\\n\\n_______________________________\\n\\n\\nSong #49: \\"Tom Ames\' Prayer\\"\\nWho Made it: Steve Earle\\nYear: 1995\\n_______________________________\\n\\n\\nThoughts: I\'m heading to a Steve Earle concert in an hour, so I figure it\'s a good time for another SE classic. I\'ll also say a few things about \\"Feel Alright\\" since it got stiffed last week. Double header. The show tonight is part of a solo, acoustic tour. Hard to say which song is more likely to make the setlist: \\"Tom Ames\\" has more of an unplugged, bluegrass sound already, but \\"Feel Alright\\" is more popular and a live staple. Here\'s a video of Steve and his band playing \\"Feel Alright\\" for the inmates at the Cold Creek Correctional Facility in Tennessee, \xe0 la Folsom Prison.\\n\\n\\nSteve had to play that show as part of his parole agreement after serving time for drug and weapons charges. The parole agreement also required a drug treatment program, which, probably, we can thank for keeping the man around. Last week, I mentioned that \\"Feel Alright\\" plays during the final montage of Season 2 in The Wire. Steve plays a recurring role in the show as an NA sponsor. His character, fittingly, was named Wa(y)lon. Kudos to the costume designer for going with the sleeveless shirt to show off that Copperhead Road tattoo\\n\\n\\n\\"Tom Ames\\" is itself an outlaw song, and goes with \\"Zip City\\" and \\"Gimme a Ride to Heaven Boy\\" on the storytelling shelf. The titular Tom Ames, a semi-agnostic bank robber, makes a fine narrator. It\'s a light-hearted song, full of hangings, hostages, and divine reckonings. Earle channels a Jack Sparrow precursor. Considering that \\"Tom Ames\\" comes from Steve\'s first album post-prison, it\'s nice to hear him having fun \u2014 can\'t beat \\"dad gave me ten bucks and sent me on my way\\" as an origin story.\\n\\n\\nAmes has some all-time cool guy lines. I\'d put \'if prayin\' is the same as beggin\' lord, I don\'t take no charity\' up against any James Bond one-liner. The delivery adds to the fun, since Earle knocks syllables down like dominoes. Listen to these lines:\\n* Everyone in Nacadoches...\\n* And one day his daddy took a ten dollar bill...\\n* Just a little bit of luck will do...\\n* Well I guess he could kept on preachin\' til Christmas...\\n* I had some help from you lord and the devil himself...\\nSomething in how he spits those out makes them sail. Add in the big ol\' bass, tasteful mandolin, and some flatpicking, and we get the catchiest crime-tune since \\"Renegade\\". We\'ll hear from Steve\'s serious side as we go \u2014 he\'s had a hard life. Today, though, we smile with Tom.\\n\\n\\n\u2013Matt\\n\\n\\nAddendum: Just got back from the show. Went so hard. I should have been writing things down, but I\'m gonna try to put down some of the best tidbits now. All quotes are approximate.\\n\\n\\nHe did play \\"Tom Ames.\\" I usually don\'t like taking videos at concerts, but I snagged a clip for the sake of journalistic excellence. Attached below. Damn people nearby kept talking through the whole show, which made me angry, but didn\'t overshadow what was happening on stage.\\n\\n\\nAfter playing \\"Tom Ames,\\" he said that he wrote it when he was twenty, and that it\'s \\"exactly the kind of song that someone writes when they\'re twenty.\\"\\n\\n\\nGot some good TVZ bits. About the blues: \\"Townes once said that there\'s two kinds of music: there\'s the blues, and there\'s zip-a-dee-doo-dah.\\"\\n\\n\\nSE told a story about moving to Houston when he was 17 and meeting TVZ. Van Zandt used to spend summers in Colorado and winters in Texas and Tennessee. He had a horse named \\"Amigo\\" that he kept in Colorado, and every summer he\'d ride it from Aspen to Crested Butte. Steve then went on to tell about driving through a blizzard to Aspen for a show on his birthday. He saw the ghosts of Townes and Amigo riding past the truck. He followed that with a cover of TVZ\'s \\"Rex\'s Blues,\\" then played \\"Fort Worth Blues\\" (his own song). I hadn\'t realized that \\"Fort Worth Blues\\" was about Van Zandt, but I should have caught on earlier. Fort Worth was Van Zandt\'s hometown, and the song came out in 1997 \u2014 TVZ died Jan 1, 1997. Compare these passages from \\"High, Low, and In Between\\" and \\"Fort Worth Blues\\":\\n\\n\\nThere is the highway\\nAnd the homemade lovin\' kind\\nThe highway\'s mine\\nAnd us ramblers are getting the travelling down\\nYou fathers build with stones\\nThat stand and shine\\nHeaven\'s where you find it\\nAnd you can\'t\\nTake too much with you\\nBut daddy, don\'t you listen\\nIt\'s just this highway talkin\' (\\"High, Low and In Between\\")\\n\\n\\nYou used to say the highway was your home\\nBut we both know\\nThat ain\'t true\\nIt\'s just the only place a man can go\\nWhen he don\'t know\\nWhere he\'s travelin\' to (\\"Fort Worth Blues\\")\\n\\n\\nThe highway line hit me hard, since I\'d been thinking so much about \\"High, Low and In Between\\" just a few days ago. Completely changed my perspective on \\"Fort Worth Blues.\\" Now it\'s got me hooked.\\n\\n\\nSteve recorded an album of Van Zandt covers as a tribute in 2009. When Guy Clark and Jerry Jeff Walker died, he made albums of their songs too because, as he put it, \\"I don\'t want none of them motherfuckers hauntin\' me.\\"\\n\\n\\nDefinitely recommend catching him on tour if you get a chance. For the East Coast contingent: he plays Mass on July 18. For the western contingent: he plays Denver on August 3.\\n\\n\\nPeople cheered loud when he said \'Houston really ain\'t that bad a town.\'\\n\\n\\n\u2013Matt","artistWiki":"https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=194910","albumWiki":"https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=11911530","relatedArtists":{"album":["Steve Earle","Peter Rowan","Norman Blake","Emmylou Harris"],"other":["Steve Earle","Emmylou Harris"]}},{"number":50,"song":"Wayside/Back in Time","artist":"Gillian Welch","album":"Soul Journey","spotifyLink":"https://open.spotify.com/track/7kBgZQP85cQBKKDTmjcDf3","textBody":"6-28-2024: Wayside/Back in Time\\n\\n\\nBig #50.

We were movin\' rocks and buildin\' shitters on the Outing Club trail crew, spending precious days outside that I\'m only now just accepting are good times past and gone. He slipped two of hers onto our crew playlist among all of the greatest/worst of modern pop country and Stan Rogers. But today\'s song, \\"Wayside/Back in Time,\\"* Matt brought me into indirectly, through MattFM (or perhaps AM, now), the radio station constantly playing in his head and sometimes falling down into his mouth. I swear all summer he\'d sing to himself the two best stand-alone lines in the song:\\n\\n\\nPeaches in the summertime, apples in the fall\\nIf I can\'t have you all the time I won\'t have none at all\\n\\n\\nWelch\'s music always has one hand in the present and one in the past, writing simply and lapidarily, for the ages. The album this appears on\u2014Soul Journey\u2014does have two covers of traditionals, but you\'d be hard-pressed to pick out which two. But then you\'ll be listening to a song you\'d swear was written in the postbellum South when she\'ll drop a reference to CRT TVs, convertibles, or Napster. Even the cover of the album embodies this strange duality, the early-2000s MS-Paint quality of which I\'ve always found incredibly incongruent with the ag\xe8d songs within:\\n\\n\\n\\"Wayside/Back in Time\\" packs present and past into two verses and choruses as skillfully as any in Welch\'s collection. It references soldier\'s joy (an old fiddle tune song name that\'s also been used to refer to a whiskey/beer/morphine combo, and had been used as such in a song from the year prior by F&L artist Guy Clark) and a song cover from 1987; radio channels and horse and buggies*; it\'s a song from 2003 that cribs from an old folk song. For Welch (and Rawlings, her longtime co-creator, who is conspicuously absent on this song without his particular virtuosic picking style, save a subtle backing harmony way down low in the mix), the song is a mix of old and new, the organ contrasting with her previously sparse arrangements while still feeling like nothing more than a slight embellishment on an old time fiddle number.\\n\\n\\nIt\'s the land of contrasts here, with the fiddle and upswing at the end of each chorus somehow imbuing this plaintive song with a cheery atmosphere, making it great for sing-alongs, rousing a group with its catchy melody and driving beat. It both lands on my \'songs I can play on my guitar to get over my breakup\' playlist as well as \'Songs for Sunnier Days\' (in the form of Chris Thile\'s excellent, but tonally missing the point, cover). And lyrically, it\'s more than it seems too. At first swipe, we hear a washed-up drunk wasted on the wayside yearning for some ex-lover. But it\'s much defter than this: most of the song is yearning for many lost loves of a different sort, for the old music in old Nashville, for cheaper rail cars in Frisco, for when that soldier\'s joy didn\'t get too much the best of our plucker here\u2014in this swirl of nostalgia this former lover is actually totally unremarked-upon until the last line:\\n\\n\\nOh darlin\', the songs they played\\nAre all I got left of the love we made\\n\\n\\nIn this way, \\"Wayside\\" is on the break-up playlist but still fits during these less lonely days, when I\'m sitting here writing this as this great white cloud bears over Smarts Mountain, that mass which we looked out on all that summer we spent pushing rocks. Strumming this tune in my yard, still looking out at Smarts, I wanna go back when you were mine means much more than its baby addressee.\\n\\n\\n\u2013Kevin\\n\\n\\nP.S. I have two tickets to see Welch and Rawlings at Higher Ground in Burlington, VT on Jul 23rd at 7pm, and am looking for someone to be that second ticket. Who\'s in??\\n\\n\\n* I\'ll say, we need more songs nowadays with slashed titles.\\n\\n\\n**I spent wayyyyyy too long a time puzzling over the lyric:\\n\\n\\nHard weather, drivin\u2019 slow\\nBuggies and the hats in town for the show\\n\\n\\n\'Hats\' makes no sense to me here, yet every lyric source online has it. My conspiracy theory is that it\'s \'hacks,\' either referring to a hackney cab (a horse-drawn vehicle, like a buggy) or some unsavory characters (like \'rounders\' in the verse prior). On the studio recording, it sounds more like \'hacks\' to me; on all of the live versions*** I could find on YouTube**** (NOT including one that curiously cuts that post-chorus), I\'d say it leans towards \\"hacks\\" but often it\'s honestly too close to call (though this version really sounds like a clear \'hacks,\' and I\'d say this one does as well). Even more confusingly, sometime collaborator Chris Thile in his pronounced style CLEARLY says \'hacks\' on every live version, BUT on the studio version CLEARLY says \'hats.\' Googling \\"buggies and the hacks,\\" the Russians and the Italians agree with me, as well as Smith472120 on some random lyrics website. The mystery shall continue until I find out if the CD or vinyl versions come with official lyrics in the liner notes.\\n\\n\\n*** This version starts off with an audience member shouting \\"I HAVEN\'T TAKEN ANYTHING\\"\\n\\n\\n**** Which I can highly recommend, due to the addition of Rawlings\' pickin\'. Also, I found what appears to be a shittily ripped instrumental version, for all of your karaoke needs.","artistWiki":"https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=897049","albumWiki":"https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=3060197","relatedArtists":{"album":["Mark Ambrose","Matt Andrews","Jim Boquist","Greg Leisz","Ketcham Secor","Gillian Welch","David Rawlings"],"other":["David Rawlings","Gillian Welch"]}},{"number":51,"song":"Rough and Rocky","artist":"Emmylou Harris","album":"Blue Kentucky Girl","spotifyLink":"https://open.spotify.com/track/66GkijeYtJZQOIcoxyYXo2","textBody":"6-29-2024: Rough and Rocky\\n_______________________________\\n\\n\\nSong #51: \\"Rough and Rocky\\"\\nWho Made it: Emmylou Harris\\nYear: 1979\\n_______________________________\\n\\n\\nThoughts: This one\'s less bluesy than the other EH songs we\'ve heard. Still emotional. To quote the lady herself (from a YouTube video), \\"This is actually one of my favorite songs of all time. It\'s an old traditional song, but I just love the words. They\'re so desperately sad.\\" It\'s fitting, then, that \\"Rough and Rocky\\" comes off Blue Kentucky Girl. Harris grew up in Alabama and Virginia \u2014 not Kentucky \u2014 but has the bluegrass spirit. Adding credibility, Country Music Hall of Famer Ricky Skaggs played mandolin for Harris\' Hot Band at the time. He wore a cool jacket.\\n\\n\\n\\"R&R\\" has many recordings. I like the genre-balancing in Harris\' take. It even gets into Zydeco territory when the accordion takes off in the second half. The Louisiana influence comes out more in a few of her other songs as well.\\n\\n\\nThe first minute is gold. Harris plays the shimmery guitar, and the Skaggs-olin works a perfect accent. Listen carefully with some headphones, and you can hear EH inhale before each line.\\n\\n\\nA lesson for songwriters: we can only hear so much at once. Focus on one thing and you ignore another. Emmylou and Co. kept this in mind while arranging \\"R&R\\" and accommodated our limited bandwidths: instrumental layers accumulate through the song, while the lyrics grow simpler. Get the beautiful words out there, then back off. Let the band play. I made a chart on Snapchat to visualize the progression:\\n\\n\\nOther band members worth noting: percussionist Brian Ahern (also producer) was married to EH when they recorded \\"Blue Kentucky Girl.\\" The background vocalists on \\"R&R\\", and for most of the album, are Sharon Hicks and Cheryl Warren.

Expect farmers. \\n\\n\\n_______________________________\\n\\n\\nSong #52: \\"Mr. Bojangles\\"\\nWho Made it: Jerry Jeff Walker\\nYear: 1968\\n_______________________________\\n\\n\\nThoughts: We mentioned JJW last week in the context of Steve Earle\'s haunt-preventing cover album. He gets his own day now. Early on, Walker had (at least) two issues hindering country success: he was born in New York, and his birth name was Ronald Clyde Crosby (if you click the hyperlinks in his Spotify bio, they take you to the other Crosby). Tough draw. Electing not to remain a victim of life\'s circumstances, RCC hit the road after high-school, adopted a new moniker, and eventually settled in Texas. He fell in with the usual suspects.\\n\\n\\n(Names captioned ccw, starting from the bottom left)\\n\\n\\nAs you could guess, Walker had his own issues with alcohol. \\"Bojangles,\\" purportedly, describes Walker\'s encounter with a downtrodden tap-dancer in a New Orleans drunk tank. When the titular Bojangles brings the mood down by lamenting his dead dog, alcoholism, and frequent incarceration, a tone-deaf cellmate, wanting some cheer, asks him to do a dance \u2014  quite Pagliaccick.\\n\\n\\nThe recording has some issues with the vocals. The guitar, though, is clear. The bit from 3:30 to 4:18 sounds for all the world like a four AM, cold bench, hardly sober morning. It nails the scene. There\'s a version by John Denver that\'s more pristine, and one by Bob Dylan that\'s different, but neither are as potent. The broken vocals add the right raggedness.

It shows a quieter side of the Truckers, with about half of the album\'s tracks favoring mandolins and banjos over Gibson SGs.\\n\\n\\nGangstabilly didn\'t ship a vinyl format until getting a remaster in 2007. That\'s not interesting, but it is interesting that the version on Spotify (and, I\'m guessing, on CD) has record crackle added to the beginnings of \\"Wife Beater\\" and \\"Why Henry Drinks\\" (the side openers) and to the ends of \\"Panties\\" and \\"Sandwiches For The Road\\" (the closers). I\'d guess that the crackle on the openers are meant as Pavlovian cues \u2014 \\"time to listen up\\" \u2014 and that the closers had to match. Or, maybe, DBT saw it as a necessary nod to tradition, like phone cameras with recorded shutter sounds. Their other albums don\'t repeat the gimmick.\\n\\n\\nAs promised, \\"Panties\\" features another rough-patcher. A party scene, where an unnamed narrator meets an unnamed woman, replaces the drunk tank from \\"Bojangles.\\" In flashback, the woman tells her story. It\'s a sad situation, but it\'s not, per se, a sad song. It starts out funny:\\n\\n\\nI saw you standing in the hallway\\nRed plastic cup and one of them big long cigarettes\\nYou asked me if I could play you some Dylan\\nI said, \\"Dylan, who?\\", you told me to kiss your ass.*\\n\\n\\nThe telling dodges drama. It stays conversational, tongue-in-cheek. Just the facts. Without straying into clich\xe9s, the characters this week all show a certain toughness. It\'s part of what makes the songs appealing: they scratch an itch  between inspiration and catharsis. We see good folks in tough spots. They keep at it. They\'re heroes we hope not to be.\\n\\n\\n\u2013Matt\\n\\n\\n*One of the record sleeves from the POB re-issue of Lubbock on Everything has a picture of \\"Some Important Guidelines\\" that Terry Allen wrote for himself. One states: \\"Don\'t make fun of scoff at Bob Dylan just because everybody else does. He\'s done very well.\\" When I thought to call Bob\'s version of \\"Bojangles\\" yesterday \\"bad\\" instead of \\"different,\\" Terry\'s words stopped me.

Add filters for mandolin and helicopters, and \\"Growing Trade\\" still isn\'t alone \u2014 see \\"Copperhead Road\\". In its niche, though, \\"Growing Trade\\" stands apart. Helm (who was almost 70 when he recorded Electric Dirt) makes the perfect embattled farmer. He puts every line up front, clear and creaky, full of down-home dignity. As endorsed by The Boss, he has the best voice in the business. He drummed, too, and looked great in a trucker hat \u2014 all the makings of an icon. He\'s most famous for his years with The Band, but his solo stuff shines. On Electric Dirt, his roots show through.\\n\\n\\nHelm was born to farming parents in Arkansas. He writes from experience: it\'s a tough job. The narrator in \\"Growing Trade\\" contends not just with fickle land and weather (\'too many seasons are calamity\'), but with constrictive bankers (\'too much interest on the loan\') and, eventually, \'the feds.\' Amid all that hardship, a question: what to do? He has an obligation to support his family, which (at least lyrically) comes first. Financially, switching to weed makes sense. There\'s more money in \'the growing trade.\'\\n\\n\\nThat being said, the song doesn\'t dwell on the breadwinning angle. The family in the first line doesn\'t come up again. Instead, the narrator wrestles with his duty to his land and forebears. As an n-th generation farmer, he\'s concerned about \\"selling out\\":\\n\\n\\nThe summer beauty of the cotton field\\nWas like a view from heavens door\\nMy granddaddy said that harvest time\\nWas what the good Lord made us for\\n\\n\\nI guess he\'d wonder where\'s the dignity\\nIn a crop you raise to burn\\nBut this land is my legacy\\nI got nowhere else to turn\\n\\n\\nBefore he sold his land and bought an RV, my Grandpa John used to complain about fellow farmers selling their corn for ethanol instead of feed\u2014 another \'crop you raise to burn.\' Grandpa John was mostly a veterinarian, though, and only took up farming as a side-gig. He could afford his \\"principled\\" stance. Without a choice, you \'do what [you] can to survive\'. Helm\'s character makes the switch and commits, accepting repercussions:\\n\\n\\nThere won\'t be any difference\\nWhen they take it all away\\nBetween the cop in the jailhouse\\nAnd a bed out beneath the clay\\nI guess there\'s nothing to do now but pray\\n\\n\\nTo be clear: I never want to find myself on the losing end of a shotgun/helicopter showdown. But, I can appreciate dignity in the face of demise. The ideal \\"last-stand\\" may be more common in fantasy, with its Jon Snows and Boromirs, but this folksy version works just as well. The option-stripped farmer takes his final chance to assert his agency. He leaves behind a banged-up helicopter and a lot of weed.

I know the hits, but that\'s all. Still, the man has great hits. I remember hearing \\"Margaritaville\\" on the oldies station in the car as a kid, and I remember it being one of the first songs I liked. By that, I don\'t just mean \\"enjoyed when it came on.\\" I mean I remembered it, recognized it, and felt sad when it ended. I\'m not sure when, psychologically, kids get the ability to store songs like that, but it dawned for me during one of those early roadtrips.\\n\\n\\nOther Jimmy B memories: on a different childhood roadtrip, I heard \\"Cheeseburger in Paradise.\\" I made it the trip anthem, and ordered a cheeseburger (no onion) at every stop. Fifteen years later, spring of 2020, I was holed up in The Rock, quarantining. We got bored and organized a Senior Week burger eating contest, which had been on my bucket list. We called ahead to McDonalds, ordered fifty $1 hamburgers (cheese cost extra), and brought them back home. We sat on the picnic tables out front, competed*, and listened to a burger-centric playlist that Kevin D made for the occasion. The list:\\n1. \\"Cheeseburger in Paradise\\"\\n2. \\"Jack & Diane\\" (dogs count)\\n3. \\"The Bob\'s Burgers Theme Song\\"\\n4. \\"His Cheeseburger\\"\\n5. \\"Rock N Roll McDonalds\\"\\nWe looped it many times. \\"CIP\\" takes me back to that. So, last September, I was sad when Jimmy died. I went to the record store to buy an album, and they had it playing when I got there. \\n\\n\\nI\'m not sure when I first heard \\"A Pirate Looks At Forty.\\" I know Sean likes it, so he probably got me started. It\'s a favorite \u2014 maybe a little outside our usual niche, but it warrants an exception. There\'s also a video of Jimmy playing it with Jerry Jeff Walker, which is a nice coincidence.\\n\\n\\nNow, who hasn\'t wanted to be a pirate? I grew up landlocked, but that didn\'t stop me. Add \\"a thousand miles too dry\\" to \'two hundred years too late.\' I\'ve wanted to be a pirate, and I\'ve wanted to be a hundred other things. Or, more accurately, I\'ve wanted to pirate (as a verb), and I\'ve wanted to do those other things. After a good movie, I want to direct; after a good book, I want to write. I hate doors closing. I remember watching Black Swan when I was 17 or 18 and getting upset because I knew I was too old to start a career in ballet. I\'d never planned to dance, but I wanted the option. Similarly, I\'m afraid of kidney stones: not because of the pain, but because someone told me that NASA won\'t make you an astronaut if you\'ve ever had one \u2014 a little dream lost.\\n\\n\\nWhy rephrase from \\"be\\" to \\"do\\"? The first is too exclusive: if I \\"am\\" a pirate, that\'s my whole thing. If I \\"do\\" some pirating, I can branch out. There\'s much I want to do, little I want to be. A career sounds tough, but no one\'s hiring dilettantes.

If you thought we\'d get through the year without any Springsteen, bad guess. I adhere to a strict custom of acceptable music on the fourth, and Bruce tops the list. You could argue that \\"Wild Billy\\" isn\'t country. You could argue that, if I were set on including The Boss, I could have picked a better 4th of July song (like this, or this, or this), or one from his country album. Fair points, but inconsequential. This is the right pick.\\n\\n\\nWhy? First, because it fits this week\'s burnout theme. We get a whole slew of tragic characters: a heat-stroked fire eater, a scorned little person, a poorly aimed cannonball \u2014 the works. It\'s a circus, after all: bastion of glamour and sadness. There should be more country songs about circuses, especially the traveling kind. Who better embodies the highway-homed ideal, the road-warrior, than a clown on tour? Maybe no one.\\n\\n\\nAmong all the duds, though, we almost get a hero. One man strikes out. He ditches the haze, quits the pageant, and tries his luck. Here\'s his one-verse story:\\n\\n\\nA ragged suitcase in his hand, he steals silently away from the circus grounds\\nAnd the highway\'s haunted by the carnival sounds\\nThey dance like a great greasepaint ghost on the wind\\nA man in baggy pants, a lonely face, a crazy grin\\nRunnin\' home to some small Ohio town\\nJesus, send some good women to save all your clowns\\n\\n\\nThe escape is all we get. We don\'t know how he fares in the Ohio town, or if Jesus sends him a good woman. Remember: the song\'s about the circus, not the clown. He crosses the threshold and leaves consideration. Business continues. Does his flight wound the beast? Maybe for a while, but not long. The Circus giveth, and the Circus taketh away. In the last lines, a reincarnation:\\n\\n\\nAnd the ferris wheel turns and turns like it ain\'t ever gonna stop\\nAnd the circus boss leans over, whispers into the little boy\'s ear\\n\\"Hey son, you want to try the big top?\\"\\nAll aboard, Nebraska\'s our next stop\\n\\n\\nOne let go, one taken. It ain\'t ever gonna stop. Circus-train rolls on, as it did and will. But, it\'s not all bleak. The circus can be a fun place. There\'s some comfort in the last couple verses, with the band dialed-in, the barker schmoozing, and the little guy way up, way up on the big man\'s shoulders. Localized joy. Again, there\'s the toughness, the keep-on-tickin\' opportunism that folks often find. No shame in getting by. \\n\\n\\nSince this is the only Springsteen song for the year, I\'ll take the chance to say some more. My dad used to have an old Jeep. It was the car he had when he was in school, and it\'s the car he drove to his wedding. He had a bunch of tapes in it, but the only one he ever played was Darkness on the Edge of Town. That\'s what hooked me. Growing up, I heard it every summer Saturday when we\'d drive to my Grandma\'s. I mowed while Dad drank iced tea. She\'d pay me $10. Later, Bruce was a fixture through college and the backbone of many party playlists. I even saw him live, with the fellas, in Boston last year. Here\'s our picture:\\n\\n\\nKevin and Geordi were in the stands. When I went home last summer, it felt good to compare notes with my dad on his Springsteen concert \\"back in the day\\" and my recent experience. From him to me, and from me down the line: on to the next stop.\\n\\n\\n\u2013Matt","artistWiki":"https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=60192","albumWiki":"https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=100350","relatedArtists":{"album":["Bruce Springsteen","Clarence Clemons","Danny Federici","Garry Tallent","David Sancious","Richard Blackwell","Suki Lahav","Louis Lahav","David Gahr"],"other":["Danny Federici","Bruce Springsteen","David Sancious","Clarence Clemons","Garry Tallent","Suki Lahav"]}},{"number":57,"song":"Victim Of Life\'s Circumstances","artist":"Delbert McClinton","album":"Honky Tonk \'N Blues","spotifyLink":"https://open.spotify.com/track/0CAYpoj5TXITeKEkodfrvy","textBody":"7-5-2024: Victim of Life\u2019s Circumstances\\n\\n\\n_______________________________\\n\\n\\nSong #57: \\"Victim Of Life\'s Circumstances\\"\\nWho Made it: Delbert McClinton\\nYear: 1975\\n_______________________________\\n\\n\\nThoughts: First off, Delbert\'s got that guitar juiced up. Tone-wise, it\'s some of the best pickin\' on the list. It reminds me of this Pixies demo, where the electric guitar sounds extra electric. You\'d never expect a song that starts with \'six-o-five AM on Sunday morning\' to be so fun. Delbert brings an entirely different vibe to the drunk tank than Jerry Jeff did, and that\'s no bad thing. We need a counterpoint to all this week\'s stoicism.\\n\\n\\n\\"Victim\\" packs a lot of blame casting into its two minutes and twenty-three seconds. Blame the highway places, wine, and barrooms. Blame those damned Friday night dances. It might not foster personal development, but it sure makes for a good song. Take it as satire if you want, or take it straight up. The point is, we\'ve had plenty of poetic songs. We\'ve had introspective songs, and we\'ve had sad songs. Those are all fine. But, sometimes, you just want to hear a fella with a nice voice and a blazing guitar. Here he is.\\n\\n\\nBy the way, McClinton is another Lubbock boy. Lots of firepower coming out of that city.

F-bombs imminent.\\n_______________________________\\n\\n\\nSong #58: \\"Fuck Up\\"\\nWho Made it: Sarah Shook & the Disarmers\\nYear: 2015\\n_______________________________\\n\\n\\nThoughts: Some preliminaries: \\"Fuck Up\\" comes with a Jack G commendation. He pointed me to Shook & the Disarmers a few weeks ago when we heard \\"South of Cincinnati\\" (F&L #34). The connection is \\"Dwight Yoakam\\". Jack also tipped me off about a great NYT profile of River Shook, the bandleader \u2014 read that before you read this. As Jack put it, \\"they have a country backstory as true blue as any I\'ve yet heard.\\" I agree. It\'s an important story, too, because it takes a happy turn.\\n\\n\\n\\"Fuck Up,\\" as the lyrics make clear, was not written from the straight and narrow. Speaking as a non-expert, these aren\'t the words of someone who\'s thriving:\\n\\n\\nI can\'t cry myself to sleep\\nSo I drink myself to death\\nI got cocaine in my bloodstream\\nAnd whisky on my breath\\n\\n\\nIt\'s a pattern we\'ve seen before. As the article puts it, \\"hard drinking and tunes about hard times [remain] a potent tandem.\\" For balance, Shook pairs the bleak lyrics with a full, dynamic sound. They launch some words with micro-yodels (used, guess, givin\'...) and push others through low shudders (bloodstream is the best example). Disarming wit keeps the song floating, with lines like \'I\'m lousy in a fist fight even if I have a knife\' and \'God doesn\'t make mistakes, he just makes fuck-ups\' putting some humor in the mix. Under the cleverness, though, the issues remain. How should you approach good music that comes from painful places?\\n\\n\\nIt\'s a tough nut to crack, in part due to chicken-and-egg issues. Songs about the road\'s toll launch new tours. Confessions fund bad habits. Listen to enough of it, and you start to feel guilty. Should you blame the audience? That\'s too big a question to tackle in one shot. This line from Gillian Welch\'s \\"Everything is Free\\" comes to mind:\\n\\n\\nSomeone hit the big score, they figured it out\\nThat we\'re gonna do it anyway, even if it doesn\'t pay\\n\\n\\nMaybe I\'m scrounging, but \'gonna do it anyway\' sounds true. Folks write songs like these because they need to. When someone sings the blues, don\'t ignore them. Shook wrote \\"Fuck Up\\" from a tough place, for sure, and it remains their highest-streamed song. But, that didn\'t convince them to stay there. Quoting again, \\"in July 2019, following a Canadian bacchanalia, Shook accepted their own ultimatum: Sober up or die trying.\\" Shook kicked the poison, and the music helped them do it. That\'s the upshot. We\'re ending down-and-out week with someone on the up-and-up: \\"a nonbinary, atheist, vegan single parent using incisive and honest country songs to unpack past baggage.\\" In my book, that\'s someone worth hearing.\\n\\n\\n\u2013Matt","artistWiki":"https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=54323844","albumWiki":"https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=54323844","relatedArtists":{"album":[],"other":["Sarah Shook","The Disarmers"]}},{"number":59,"song":"Hands on the Wheel","artist":"Willie Nelson","album":"Red Headed Stranger","spotifyLink":"https://open.spotify.com/track/6C8nBZQw7yyPQ1jkelFYX5","textBody":"7-7-2024: Hands on the Wheel\\n\\n\\nHad to get here at some point. Not all roads lead to Willie, but most pass by. He\'s been at it for a long time, and he\'s widely beloved. The handful of his songs that I picked for this list don\'t span his career or try to capture his spirit (whatever that would mean).

More quiet than your usual sing-and-strum acoustic tune. It\'s full of open space. It sounds even quieter when he plays it live, like in this ACL video. The crowd sits dumb. Maybe restraint is part of the secret to Willie\'s longevity. His guitar solo at the end of \\"Hands\\" feels natural in a perfect sense: everything you need, nothing you don\'t. We come back to craftsmanship.\\n\\n\\nRecall \\"Sleeping on Hold\\" (F&L #24), a song about lapsing into auto-pilot, drifting, and sleeping through the years. \\"Hands\\" is a counterpoint \u2014 a wake-up song. Pay attention to the first few seconds of your day. Sometimes, you wake up sour. Your thoughts turn gloomy; you groan and close your eyes \u2014 no good to have too many of those in a row. When you do, change is in order. \\n\\n\\nMore often, though, you wake up flat. Not too bad, but not much spark. Those are the days when \'living is just something [you] do.\' String a bunch together, and they wear you down. You might start \\"Sleeping on Hold.\\" You need a jolt. \\n\\n\\nThe third morning, the best morning, is the morning when you want to get up \u2014 even better if you know why you want to get up. When the brain kicks in and the first thought is lucky, when you claim potential, when your hand\'s on the wheel, you fly for free. The spark hits your spine and spits out suspense. You know how to live and you do it.\\n\\n\\nWhat makes the spark? What\'s behind those lucky mornings? It might not be the only thing, but the surest shot\'s some lovin\'. Take it from Willie, if not from me. Here\'s what woke him up:\\n\\n\\nWell, it\'s the same damn tune, it\'s the man in the moon\\nIt\'s the way that I feel about you\\nAnd with no place to hide, I looked in your eyes\\nAnd I\'ve found myself in you\\n\\n\\nAin\'t that sweet? It\'s not so common to find yourself. You don\'t forget it when you do. You don\'t forget the spark, and you don\'t forget the eyes. More than not forgetting, you want to remember. You want to put it down.

I got lucky and never lost power. I stayed put till afternoon, sat at my desk, and looked out the window. Here\'s a peek behind the scenes at the corner where I do the emails:\\n\\n\\nI got the drawing (left) at the MFAH community art sale, and the painting at my old school. My uncle gave me the guitar.

The last word lands with three minutes left, followed by a short interlude. At 4:28, a new guitar comes in and takes over. I like to think that the solo guy sat in the back of the studio rippin\' cigs and getting his mind right until his part came up. He takes his time getting going. Get the kinks out. It sounds improvised in a good way, like he trusts his gut. Clouds gather. By 5:11, the warmup is over. The first punch lands. He rages for a while, then bows out \u2014 very proud, very smooth.

I put Linda Ronstadt\'s version in a close second place after Joni Mitchell\'s, but Ronstadt\'s take has pedal-steel to grant western bonafides. I\'m willing to play fast and loose with my own rules, but I can\'t make JM country. She goes on a different playlist.\\n\\n\\nNow, on to some grammar. I\'m usually anti-adverb. William \\"Baller Bill\\" Craig got me in the habit years ago of striking any word ending in \\"-ly\\" from my writing. But, with all respect to Bill, I think that a well-placed adverb makes a difference in the first verse of \\"Eyes\\":\\n\\n\\nWell the sun is slowly sinking down\\nThe moon is surely rising*\\nAnd this old world must still be spinning \'round\\nAnd I still love you\\n\\n\\nThe first adverb (slowly) I could take or leave. I think it\'s just there to get the syllables right. But the second adverb (surely) matters. It doesn\'t matter because it convinces us that the moon is rising. We all know the moon rises. The issue with adverbs, per Bill, is that they tend to do the opposite of what they ought to do. They\'re fluff words. They distract from bluffs. If a waiter says \\"I recommend the salmon,\\" I\'ll believe him. If he says \\"I absolutely recommend the salmon,\\" I\'ll think he\'s trying to use up last week\'s special. It\'s similar here with \\"surely\\": putting the adverb in front makes the moon\'s path sound like something we might question. The same thing happens with \\"must\\" \u2014 must it?\\n\\n\\nThe wordings cast doubt on celestial certainties. It\'s not because James and Linda and Joni don\'t believe in orbits, but because there\'s a higher truth. There\'s something more certain:\\n\\n\\nI still love you.\\n\\n\\nNo hiding, no bluffing there. Say what you mean in plain speak. They strengthen that line by weakening the ones before it \u2014 a clever trick, and a fine use of badverbs.\\n\\n\\n\u2013Matt\\n\\n\\n* In the original, James swaps \\"surely\\" and \\"slowly\\" so that the sun sinks surely and the moon rises slowly. In Joni\'s version, both lines say \\"surely.\\" James\' swap still has the same effect, but I think the loss of \\"surely\\" makes Joni\'s version a little weaker. Or, maybe, the adverbs don\'t matter that much. Up for debate. Chime in if you have strong opinions.","artistWiki":"https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=160760","albumWiki":"https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=1492005","relatedArtists":{"album":["Linda Ronstadt","Andrew Gold","Eddie Black","Bob Warford","Sneaky Pete Kleinow","JD Souther","Herb Pedersen","Paul Craft","John Starling","Danny Pendleton","John Boylan","Glenn Frey","Kenny Edwards","Chris Ethridge","Emory Gordy Jr.","Tom Guidera","Timothy B.

The sentences on their own are fine, but they don\'t fit together in a frame. I\'m not saying that to get myself off the hook, either. It\'s part of The Gourds\' style. They got together in Austin in 1994, three years after Slacker (set in Austin) and six before \\"Keep Austin Weird.\\" Incoherence had a moment. Frontman Kevin Russell, in the trailer to All The Labor: The Story Of The Gourds, puts it like this:\\n\\n\\nIt pisses them off that we play what seems like nonsense to them. It\'s blurry; it\'s chaotic; it\'s highly impressionistic. I know. And it can be frustrating to the objective mind. . . The Gourds are not easy to sell. They\'re not easy to understand. It\'s just not easy. The Gourds are a difficult, tangled, complex, weird, awkward mess. But, it\'s worth it.\\n\\n\\n\\"Weird, awkward mess\\" must have been in the air. There\'s a scene in Slacker where a man on the hunt for TVs meets a woman handing out Oblique Strategies \u2014 a sort of fortune cookie/tarot card hybrid designed by Brian Eno. Since it\'s a Linklater movie, they lapse into sidewalk philosophy. While a woman in the background arranges her menstruation inspired pottery installation, the card dealer speaks her mind:\\n\\n\\nI\'ve been banging my head against this nineteenth century thought type, uh, what, thought mode? Construct? Human construct? Well the wall doesn\'t exist, it\'s not there, ya know? I mean they tell ya look for the light at the end of the tunnel. Well, there is no tunnel. There\'s no structure. The underlying order is chaos, man.\\n\\n\\nReflecting back to The Gourds: \\"chaos as underlying order\\" nails it. I think it\'s the first song we\'ve heard with a prominent g\xfciro*. I\'m sure it\'s the first song to bring up dead horses, chasing rats, and an aviational warning in the first minute. Russell\'s voice is the brighter one. Jimmy Smith (guitarist) does the low harmony. It\'s a minimal arrangement with plenty to chew. For some contrast in the Austin-sphere, compare \\"Pines\\" to \\"Hands on the Wheel\\" \u2014very different songs, very different artists, but both, in their own way, keepin\' it weird.\\n\\n\\n\u2013Matt\\n\\n\\n* Spanish for \\"gourd.\\" Unsure if pun intended.","artistWiki":"https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=2244716","albumWiki":"https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=2244716","relatedArtists":{"album":[],"other":["The Gourds"]}},{"number":63,"song":"Alone Again Or","artist":"Calexico","album":"Convict Pool","spotifyLink":"https://open.spotify.com/track/5cG90AasL6Fd9uTwAMF1tS","textBody":"7-11-2024: Alone Again Or\\n\\n\\n_______________________________\\n\\n\\nSong #63: \\"Alone Again Or\\"\\nWho Made it: Calexico\\nYear: 2004\\n_______________________________\\n\\n\\nThoughts: Going heavy on movie tie-ins* and covers this week. The original version of \\"Alone Again Or\\" comes from Love\'s album Forever Changes (1967). It\'s great. But the Calexico cover, like Ronstandt\'s \\"YCCYE,\\" lands a bit closer to our target genre. As is often true, there\'s a relevant Terry Allen anecdote. Asked by his biographer to describe his music, Terry replied that \\"People tell me it\u2019s country music, and I ask, \'Which country?\'\\"\\n\\n\\nCalexico might say the same. They\'re based in Arizona, but you can hear the  \\"-exico\\" in \\"Alone,\\" particularly in the interlude from 1:45 to 2:15. Much of their music (including their sophomore concept album) deals with the same borderlands that fed Allen, Bola\xf1o, and however many others you\'d care to list. The lesson: put more circles in your Venn diagrams.\\n\\n\\n\\"Alone\\" gets stuck in my head when I go to HEB. More often than not, while I load up on rice/beans/yogurt, I think about the chorus:\\n\\n\\nYeah, I heard a funny thing\\nSomebody said to me\\n\\"You know that I could be in love with almost everyone\\nI think that people are the greatest fun\\"\\n\\n\\nCan\'t help it: I crush easy. You see a lot of interesting, good-looking folks in a big city grocery store. You could be in love with almost everyone. It\'s temporary love, gone in a few hours, but it makes those hours interesting. Airports are also good spots for dreaming about love. I used to always buy chocolate while I waited to board: that way, on the off chance that my soulmate sat next to me, I had an easy ice-breaker. Offer to share; strike up a conversation. The plan never came through, but I like the hopeful outlook. You never know who\'ll be in the next seat over \u2014 or the yogurt aisle.\\n\\n\\n\u2013Matt\\n\\n\\n* The tie-in here is to Bottle Rocket, the best Wes Anderson movie. Love\'s original version of \\"Alone Again Or\\" plays when the Luke Wilson character leaves the Owen Wilson character to find his love-interest at her job. I\'ll rate the scene PG-13 for mild sensuality.","artistWiki":"https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=910078","albumWiki":"https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=5591148","relatedArtists":{"album":[],"other":[]}},{"number":64,"song":"These Days","artist":"Gregg Allman","album":"Laid Back","spotifyLink":"https://open.spotify.com/track/0MP0r359Vwc7ysIrC3wYvO","textBody":"7-12-2024: These Days\\n\\n\\n_______________________________\\n\\n\\nSong #64: \\"These Days\\"\\nWho Made it: Gregg Allman\\nYear: 1973\\n_______________________________\\n\\n\\nThoughts: Another day, another Luke Wilson love song. Three important versions of \\"These Days\\":\\n1. The writer\'s version (Jackson Browne)\\n2. The hit (Nico)\\n3. The subject (Gregg Allman)\\nAll have their merits. Browne brings his usual Everyman spirit and a powerhouse outro. Nico makes it cozy and curious, with a great string section. Forced to critique, though, I\'d say that Browne\'s is a little too grand, and Nico\'s a little too studied. Allman hits the sweet spot. When he says it, I believe that he has \'been out walking\' (in the fullest sense).\\n\\n\\nToday could have almost gone with last week\'s down-on-their-luckers. I\'d put JB and Nico with them. Not so for Allman. Beside the sound, lyrical differences between the three tint the moods. Nico\'s is the least hopeful. It looks back and down. She\'s the only one to say \'I\'ve stopped my dreaming\' \u2014 anyway you cut it, a pretty sad line. \\n\\n\\nJB brightens up a little. Not too tangible, but there\'s hope: \\n\\n\\nWell I\'ll keep on movin\' (movin\' on)\\nThings are bound to be improvin\' these days\\nOne of these days\\n\\n\\nHe\'s been losing, but he\'s holding out for a break.  He wants better, he believes in better, but he hasn\'t gone after it. No mention of giving up dreams, but not much view of the road ahead. He\'s movin\' on for the sake of movin\' on. Has he gone anywhere? Maybe not yet.\\n\\n\\nOf the three, Allman\'s walking seems to have been the most productive. He got down to bedrock:\\n\\n\\nThese days I sit on the corner stones\\nCount the time in quarter tones \'til ten, my friend\\nAnd now I believe I\'ve come to see myself again*\\n\\n\\nLet\'s get it straight: you ain\'t goin\' nowhere if you don\'t bring yourself along. It\'s not automatic. Think of all the ways you can not see yourself. I\'ll tie it back to \\"Flatness\\" (F&L #14) and the balance between consumption that promotes thought and consumption that suppresses it. You can swap \\"thought\\" for \\"self-awareness.\\" Avoid yourself too long, suppress self digestion, and anything good starts to seem like a fluke, like pride is something behind you. That was something \\"I\\" did last year, not something I can do now. It\'s harder to believe in your self who\'s doing things now than the self who already did something. When you don\'t see yourself as yourself, the schism keeps you down:\\n\\n\\nThese days I seem to be afraid\\nTo live the life that I have made in song\\n\\n\\nSo, you\'ve got to get back into the fold. Sit with your thoughts. Chew on the hard ones. Make like Nico/JB/Gregg and go for a walk \u2014 a literal one. \\n\\n\\nClosing thought as the clock runs down: \\"These Days\\" gets a spot in the last-line hall of fame.\\n\\n\\nPlease don\'t confront me with my failures. \\nI\'m aware of them. **\\n\\n\\nHumble, enlightened, succinct. Be aware of your failures; be aware of your successes.

Now, some solo stuff. Sturg has been among the most buzzed names in tolerable country for the past 10 years. He\'s even parlayed his musical success into acting on a Danny McBride show. Today, he gets the coveted F&L Saturday slot. How much higher can he climb?\\n_______________________________\\n\\n\\nSong #65: \\"Welcome to Earth (Pollywog)\\"\\nWho Made it: Sturgill Simpson\\nYear: 2016\\n_______________________________\\n\\n\\nThoughts: This is where I bend the rules a bit. I chose not to do bluegrass. \\"Welcome to Earth\\" (2016) is not bluegrass. But, we need its context. Part of that context is the Stu-grass rendition from 2020. The original is the pick, but both are on the table.\\n\\n\\n\\"Welcome\\" on A Sailor\'s Guide to Earth uses some stagecraft: sea sounds, reverb, orchestral flourishes. It\'s the opener, and has to pull double duty to set up what follows. Sturgill leans into the theatricality of the album, belting out \'that the answer was so easy\' like he\'s landing Valjean on dirt road Broadway. The steel guitar reminds us who we\'re dealing with. It\'s grand staging for the big switch-up: the horns, the drums, and the electric piano that land at 2:44. He spends the rest of the song strutting and calling lines to himself, coating the tender bits with a layer of pizzazz. The heart\'s behind the glitz.\\n\\n\\n\\"Welcome\\" (2020) takes a different approach. The staging falls back, and we get a clear view. The arc is the same, with the first half building to the kicker. Stu-grass retains the mid-song payoff: it\'s not as loud, but you feel the change. It\'s the difference between reading a letter and speaking in person. The first half is tender and considered. Post break, it\'s raw and urgent. The gates are open. He has momentum, and he\'s taking the chance to put it all out there:\\n\\n\\nAnd if sometimes daddy has to go away\\nOh please don\'t think that it means I don\'t love you\\nOh how I wish I could be there everyday\\n\'Cause when I\'m gone it makes me so sad and blue\\nAnd holding you is the greatest love I\'ve ever known\\nOh, when I get home it breaks my heart to see how much you\'ve grown\\nAll on your own\\n\\n\\nWhile Simpson cuts his heart out, a full lineup supports him \u2014 his backers include Stuart Duncan, Sierra Hull, and Tim O\'Brien. The all-star team delivers. The banjo sheen and earthshake bass do most of the work, with some chops and runs for flair. The mood inflects at \'home.\' Sturg hits peak emotion, then hands off to the band for a doozy of an outro. Listen a few times, trying to follow different lines. Masters at work.\\n\\n\\nI\'ve said before that you come across some songs when they\'ll hit you hardest. For me, such is not the case with \\"Welcome\\". It can still improve. I have it saved on my EPP (\\"Eventual Papa Playlist\\"), where it sits accruing interest. Those songs are already good, good to me as a bachelor, but could flourish in the right (familial) circumstance. Thankfully, not yet. In lieu of reality, a thought experiment: imagine yourself down the road, gone the family way. You\'re traveling alone, ni\xf1os back home, and hear \\"Welcome\\" \u2014 guaranteed tears. Circle back when the time is right. \\n\\n\\n\u2013Matt\\n\\n\\nEditorial note: I was going to do \\"Oh Sarah\\" today, also with the bluegrass take. Then, I thought I\'d do both pairs (Sarah/Welcome) together. I started putting thoughts down on \\"Welcome\\" and decided that was enough to tackle \u2014 much more could get garbled. But, if you\'re interested, try listening to the four tracks together. Recommended order: Welcome \'16 \u2192 Sarah \'16 \u2192 Sarah \'20 \u2192 Welcome \'20.","artistWiki":"https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=42522959","albumWiki":"https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=49643948","relatedArtists":{"album":["Sturgill Simpson","Miles Miller","Robert Emmett","Dan Dugmore","Jefferson Steinberg","Dave Roe","Laur Joamets","Jefferson Crow","Garo Yellin","Arthur Cook","Jonathan Dinklage","Whitney LaGrange","Neal Sugarman","Dave Guy","Ian Hendrickson-Smith","Clark Gayton","Dougie Wilkinson","Kevin Black","David Ferguson","Gavin Lurssen","Sean Sullivan","Geoff Allan","Ebonie Smith","Kilian Eng","Mark Stutzman","Matthew Meiners"],"other":["Sturgill Simpson","Miles Miller"]}},{"number":66,"song":"Early Blue","artist":"F.J.

Here\'s another guy in the Mark Jones (F&L #12) camp. Spirit of the Golden Juice is McMahon\'s only album \u2014 not quite a Billboard hit, but, thanks to attention from some re-releases, it has a healthy play-count. I\'m happy to toss it a few more.\\n_______________________________\\n\\n\\nSong #66: \\"Early Blue\\"\\nWho Made it: F.J. McMahon\\nYear: 1969\\n_______________________________\\n\\n\\nThoughts: Here\'s a comfortable one. \\"Early Blue\\" has some of the same low-tech warmth that makes AM radio appealing. There\'s a nice amount of muffling, like during a big snow. The drum hits are more like pats. Very cozy. McMahon\'s voice adds to the sleepy effect: modulo the accent, he reminds me of Joe Pera. The drawn out \'Go, run away\' is extra smooth. It\'s a voice well-made for tired hours, as aligns with the lyrics:\\n\\n\\nBut I know it\'ll happen soon\\nEarly blue come to my room next morning\\nAnd I\'ll try to go to sleep\\nBut it won\'t work, I\'ll have to seek my friends\\nWhere they go, What they know\\n\\n\\nThe solo from 1:47 to 2:10 is mysterious to me. I\'m not sure if it\'s a synthesizer or an electric organ \u2014some sort of electric key instrument. Either way, I\'d expect those things to clash with the rest of the song, but the solo fits right in. It sounds like an acoustic electric organ, like FJ pulled it down from the attic and had to turn a hand crank for a while to get it going. Not at all unpleasant.\\n\\n\\nA subtle point: I don\'t mean that \\"Early Blue\\" is boring. \\"Boring\\" is an empty song that makes you irritated. \\"Soothing\\" is a full song that calms you down. \\"EB\\" is soothing. I also like what it says about friends: friends are good for making things work out fine, and they are nice to see when you can\'t sleep. Good reminders.\\n\\n\\n\u2013Matt\\n\\n\\nPS: Not sure if this adds or detracts from the listening experience, but there\'s a zoom interview with McMahon on YouTube.

Take your time and soak it up.\\n\\n\\n\u2013Matt\\n\\n\\n________________________________________________________\\n\\n\\nGuest Feature from Osman\\n_______________________________\\n\\n\\nSong #68: \\"Lake Marie\\"\\nWho Made it: John Prine\\nYear: 1995\\n_______________________________\\n\\n\\nThoughts:\\n\u201cPrine\u2019s stuff is pure Proustian existentialism. Midwestern mindtrips to the nth degree... stuff about Sam Stone the soldier junky daddy and Donald and Lydia, where people make love from ten miles away. Nobody but Prine could write like that. If I had to pick one song of his, it might be Lake Marie.\u201d  \u2013 Bob Dylan\\n\\n\\nSometimes when watching a great film or a great performance, my vision literally tunnels. Pure focus on what I\'m observing, total artistic mind-meld with the subject of my gaze. But also, a prickle on my neck, a rise in my gut. I feel the world I\'m being shown crawling in through my ears and not in a way that\'s comfortable. The darkness around the focal point feels heady, contains novel thoughts. \\n\\n\\n\\"Lake Marie,\\" crown jewel off of John Prine\'s Lost Dogs and Mixed Blessings, is like that. You\'re all and only looking at what\'s right ahead of you, but something in the peripheral feels real off. \\n\\n\\nBut first, a momentary interlude to talk about the album and Prine himself. \\n_______________________________\\n\\n\\nMusical comedy is hard. Absurd comedy is very hard. Absurd, sentimental, poetic comedy basically only exists in John Prine records. Dark, too. You try writing something like that, something that\'s witty and dark and sexually perverse and sentimental and musically catchy all at once. He can land a joke too: check this deadpan.\\n\\n\\nTake \\"We Are The Lonely\\" (see linked the bongo-heavy live version, followed by \\"Lake Marie\\"), the preceding song on the album, a big sexy number about all the seediest inhabitants of the phonebook. The staccato, oof, it hits:\\n\\n\\nug-ly-man treats girls-like-dirt /\\nWants-but-tons sewn uh pon-his-shirt\\n\\n\\nTry listening to this gross ditty without grooving along to the dirty electric riff or singing along with the freak call-outs. The last lines, oft-excluded from lyric look-ups, which you can make out if you turn the volume up on certain versions, are perfect Prine: \\n\\n\\nStraight but curious, 33\\nSeeks survivor at Wounded Knee\\nFarmer\'s nympho daughter moans\\nLet\'s do it till the cows come home\\n\\n\\nTwisty, twisted, irreverent, full o\' heart, American like jeans and gen-o-cide: that\'s John Prine.\\n_______________________________\\n\\n\\n\\"Lake Marie\\" has three parts and no clear answers. Listen to it and then return or you\'ll get spoiled. Check out this great Singout! post that sums up the literature on it and how the song changed down the years.\\n\\n\\nPart the First:\\n\\n\\nPrine lays out an only slightly true story of some white babies, some Indians, and woahh ah ohhh ah ohhh, Lake Marie. We have half of the focal center of our tunnel vision. Sparkling water, harmony in America. The spoken-word parts owe a lot to Jackson Browne and Native American singer/activist John Trudell\'s curse on/ode to the Eisenhower junta and its controlled opposition, the guerrilla Elvis Presley: \\"Baby Boom Che\\".\\n\\n\\nPrine said after a lovely performance on the short-lived TV show Spectacle, a musical interview/performance hour hosted by Elvis Costello (???) \\"I knew I wanted it to start with something that sounded like it was true and something that was history\\".\\n\\n\\nNote the injected ambiguity: real Matt-heads know, a dash of fiction can make the truth feel truer: recreations, not recaps.\\n\\n\\nAnother truth-massage: apparently the fair white babes were, in truth, \\"butt-ugly\\".\\n\\n\\nPart The Second:\\n\\n\\nOnto Prine\'s second and familiar focal point: a girl, a grill, some fish. Remember the badverb rule Professor Radosevich laid out in F+L #61? Here it returns.\\n\\n\\nMany years later, I found myself talking to this girl\\nWho was standing there with her back turned to Lake Marie\\nThe wind was blowing, especially through her hair\\nThere was four Italian sausages cooking on the outdoor grill\\nAnd they was s-s-sizzlin\'\\n\\n\\nWe know from Prof. Rad that that means the wind was blowin\' thru just about everything else too. The lake and the SHADOWS, THE SHADIDDLYIADDLYADOWS, and all else.\\n\\n\\nPart The Third:\\n\\n\\nAs noted by, ahem, Prine Shrine and critic Mark Guarino, Prine felt the need to include the idyll-shattering murders America saw as the boomers came of age: \\"Like it was Blue Velvet, you know?\\". He doesn\'t seem precisely too sure why, but that\'s alright. Like David Lynch, he\'s conveying a feeling, not a message, as he told Roger Ebert, his first reviewer, fifty years ago. Lynch isn\'t too far from Prine, peeking in thru people\'s windows and taking them for all in all, sex and pain included.\\n\\n\\nNote the extended sss sounds returns on exactly the same point in the verse, this time on some sssharp object. The \'burbs and the blood aren\'t too far apart.  \\n\\n\\nWe\'re still lookin\' at old Lake Marie, but something\'s intruding. Maybe through the idiot-box, maybe through the air itself. Something ain\'t right. Mister, there\'s a meanness in this world.\\n\\n\\nEpilogue:\\n\\n\\nThat last riff is still cathartic as ever, even in the later performances darkened by Prine\'s vocal wear-and-tear and the inclusion of some grimmer ending references. The tunnel narrows, the vision\'s going dim, blight\'s spread, is it necrotic? But then the song wraps, and every time, he\'s taken aback, pleasantly surprised at the crowd applauding him. Try watching that clip without breaking out in a smile. Shucks.\\n\\n\\nBut before I pretend this can all be wrapped up too neatly,\\n\\n\\nAh, baby, we gotta go now.\\n_______________________________\\n\\n\\nI eschewed the usual cork-boarding because holy shit everyone on F+L loved John Prine. Still, some highlights from those links: a story of a poker game between TVZ, Guy Clark and John Prine, Emmylou Harris blowing away every other cover of Angel of Montgomery, plus a cross-over: TVZ and Emmylou\'s \\"Loretta\\" by Steve Earle and John!

Johnston plinks; Tweedy croons \u2014 \\"Flatness\\" it aint. It\'s all pleasant enough, with the \'baaaay-be\'s and \'hoooo-ney\'s, that you could overlook the wrinkles. As a precaution, Johnston flags the first one: \'You\'ve been trying hard not to think I\'m a liar.\' Then, with a twist, before the last chorus: \'I\'ve been trying hard not to feel like a liar.\'  Lies under harmony, banjo gone sour \u2014 something\'s not right.\\n\\n\\nThe lullaby stumbles. It can\'t muster the confidence you might hope to hear as you drift off: no \\"ev-er-y-thing\'s gonna be alright,\\" or even \\"tomorrow\'s gonna be a brighter day.\\" Maybe Tweedy wasn\'t in the mood for assurances. According to Wikipedia, he was feeling some pressure:\\n\\n\\n\\"The first conceptions of material for the album came during a particularly stressful time in Tweedy\'s life. Tweedy had recently quit smoking marijuana, attendance at Wilco concerts was dwindling, and Tweedy was trying to manage his marriage, a mortgage, and the birth of his first child.\\"\\n\\n\\nPiling on, Son Volt\'s first record (Trace) had far outsold A.M., and Wilco were paying out of pocket to offer Being There (a double album, costing more to produce) at a low price  \u2014 plenty afoot to disturb sleepy thoughts. \\n\\n\\n\\"Got in Store\\" is not, though, an admission of defeat. As Tweedy said a few years later, \\"I\'ve never made anything in my life where I didn\'t feel like there was something hopeful about it.\\" He takes a pragmatic tack, and owns non-omniscience:\\n\\n\\nI just know you need your rest\\nBut I can\'t say what\'s best for you.\\n\\n\\nSelf-addressed or else, those lines are honest.

Joe Ely grew up in Lubbock around the same time as Terry Allen and Jimmie Dale Gilmore. Allen was two years older than Gilmore, and Gilmore two years older than Ely. All went to Monterey highschool (home of The Plainsmen, which means something to the Laramie crew). Ely and Gilmore, along with Butch Hancock, went on to play together in The Flatlanders (whose flagship album, More a Legend than a Band, is not on Spotify).\\n\\n\\nAccording to the TA biography, Gilmore, Hancock, and Ely went through high school hearing stories of Allen\'s antics, including his commandeering of their high school talent show to play a song he called \\"The Roman Orgy.\\" Ely, in particular, looked up to Allen:\\n\\n\\n\\"Even Ely, who rode a motorcycle down the Monterey hallways on the first day of his freshman year and was already playing bars and clubs, suspected that Terry occupied a different stratum of cool.\\" (From Truckload of Art, pg 85)\\n\\n\\nEly has had a long and varied musical career. For a while, he toured with The Clash \u2014he\'s one of the guys singing Spanish in the background of \\"Should I Stay or Should I Go\\". He played with Springsteen and with Uncle Tupelo. He recorded with TA, including the harmonica parts for Lubbock (on everything). Pretty busy! Here\'s a picture of Allen, Ely, and Linda Ronstadt crashing the Monterey graduation dance in 1982 to play a set:\\n\\n\\nAnd here\'s a picture of good friends Allen Toussaint, Guy Clark, and Joe Ely:\\n\\n\\nToussaint isn\'t on our list, but I saw him play in Laramie when I was a kid. He has a great cover of Paul Simon\'s \\"American Tune,\\" as does Willie Nelson.\\n\\n\\nTo pull all these characters down to earth, I\'ll copy a passage from TA\'s biography. The scene is at Terry & Jo Harvey\'s forty-fourth wedding anniversary, which they celebrated with friends near Marfa, TX:\\n\\n\\nEveryone parked their vehicles in a circle, turned on their radios, and kicked up the dust with their boots into the headlights\' beams, where it mingled with the fragrant barbecue smoke, like they had done as teenagers in Lubbock. Joe Ely danced so hard on the hard dirt that he reportedly limped for weeks. \\"All of a sudden,\\" Jo Harvey recalled, \\"Walking across this field out of the dark came Guy and Susanna. She was in [a] long white muumuu and black glasses.\\" She had been in bed for a long time, shattered by losing her best friend and \\"soul-mate\\" Townes Van Zandt, so no one expected it.

Saturday afternoons are more coherent than Friday nights.\\n_______________________________\\n\\n\\nSong #72: \\"The Bramble and the Rose\\"\\nWho Made it: Barbara Keith\\nYear: 1973\\n_______________________________\\n\\n\\nThoughts: BK gets underplayed. She put out two self-titled solo albums: Barbara Keith (1969) and Barbara Keith (1973). I can\'t vouch for the first one (since I can\'t find it anywhere to stream), but I love the second. It\'s on the folky side of the country-hodgepodge: mostly a piano/acoustic vehicle, with some steel guitar and string-section cameos. You can listen, start to finish, while you eat your dinner. Tracks flit between genres while Keith holds it together: your hear bits of Nicks/Krauss/Safka in her voice, but the sum stands apart  \u2014 inviting comparison, not defined by it.\\n\\n\\nA point I\'ve tried to make: the country sound runs on clear expression. If you aren\'t convinced yet, \\"B&R\\" ought to help. The opening sequence, piano and voice, sets a fine stage. Keith\'s vocals do well without much accompaniment, and the keys play little jokes. The prelude, though, would be too clean, too proper to last much longer. We need some spice. The first strums at 0:53 sound like the start of a smile, like someone about to laugh at their own joke. They\'re about to have fun. Then, right at 0:59, the juice kicks in: bass, guitar, percussion. You can hear what the intro held back. Even the accent comes out more, with extra twang on meanin\'. This is what the band wants to play. It\'s contagious: you feel like you\'re in on the joke. They quiet down for a second then bring back the drop:\\n\\n\\nSo put your arms around me\\nYes and sing a true love song\\nOne that we can sing together\\nJust to last the whole night long\\n\\n\\nThe song\'s all tangled, brambled up, intertwey-eye-ined, but not at all unpleasant: you get pulled in, feeling the lines. It\'s well made for campfires, road trips, and late-night kitchens, shoulder to shoulder. It reminds me of friendly dogpiles, like this one I took from Kellen\'s instagram:\\n\\n\\nA big ol\' rosebush and a happy man.\\n\\n\\nTying back to the big idea: \\"Bramble and the Rose\\" hits the \\"&\\" in \\"F&L.\\" It\'s a push and pull song, full of dipoles (candle/flame, bramble/rose, cruel/kind, hurt you/hurts me). It tackles the messiness, the friction of proximity. The stuff you do without really meanin\' to, the inevitable fussin\' that goes with any good lovin\'. It\'s all part and parcel. Time goes on; bonds thicken; prickles frame the blooms. And, to cap it all off, some words of comfort: \'round each other we will wind\'.\\n\\n\\nHere\'s to more winding,\\n\\n\\n\u2013Matt","artistWiki":"https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=60492068","albumWiki":"https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=60492068","relatedArtists":{"album":[],"other":["Barbara Keith"]}},{"number":73,"song":"Play Something We Know","artist":"Adam Hood","album":"6th Street","spotifyLink":"https://open.spotify.com/track/5yBRepsy1EZ8W0Lp36ODxb","textBody":"7-21-2024: Play Something We Know\\n\\n\\n_______________________________\\n\\n\\nSong #73: \\"Play Something We Know\\"\\nWho Made it: Adam Hood\\nYear: 2004\\n_______________________________\\n\\n\\nThoughts: \\"Play Something We Know\\" is the only Adam Hood song I\'ve heard. I\'ll admit that I probably got it from Discover Weekly, and that I don\'t know much about the man. I skimmed his Spotify bio: he\'s from Alabama, and his top fan cities are all in Texas (Dallas, Houston, Austin, San Antonio, and Fort Worth). So much for home cookin\'.\\n\\n\\nI\'m not planning to dive into the rest of Hood\'s discography, but I keep this song in rotation. I like the call-out gimmick. Of the twenty-one artists/songs mentioned, eight appear on our list \u2014 pretty good taste. I thought about copying the lyrics down and hyperlinking something for every act, but figured that\'d be overkill. I\'m not convinced folks are diligent with their link-clicking anyway. I leave you to do your own searching, though most are household names.\\n\\n\\nOne point I will make: like Southern Rock Opera, \\"Play Something\\" speaks to the influence that Lynyrd Skynyrd has had on this genre. I can\'t pretend that they aren\'t idolized by some unpleasant folks, but I\'ve never been unhappy to hear a Skynyrd song in a bar. There\'s more to them than some might think. To hear a much better discussion of \\"the whole Skynyrd thing and its misunderstood glory\\" than I could put together, listen to DBT\'s \\"Three Great Alabama Icons.\\"\\n\\n\\nMostly, I like \\"Play Something\\" because I relate to it. More than just sharing taste in music with its narrator, I commiserate. As Hood says: \'I know how it is dude. I used to have me a band.\' Our singer did get a girlfriend (which ended up being a very good thing, but also made him late to a few crucial rehearsals). And, no surprise, I get nostalgic. I\'m good about finding new music and trying different things, but, sometimes, new isn\'t right. Sometimes, I want ol\' reliable. Put on \\"Freeze-out;\\" put on \\"Tuesday;\\" put on Oasis.

Of note from Monday: a sheaf need not be isomorphic to its double dual, but there\'s always a good map from one to the other. Here\'s the relevant slide from my presentation, which is wobbly because I had espresso and I\'m not used to tablets:\\n\\n\\nIf you\'ve got linear algebra chops, you\'ve done this with vector spaces. When you take a dual, functions turn into points. Or, put another way, relations become objects. Inside goes out. Since the relations tell you about the objects, a dual\'s a nice thing to look at. Taking the dual of a dual (the double dual), you sometimes get back what you started with, but sometimes not. You might flip something inside out twice and get something else back.\\n\\n\\nWhat\'s that all got to do with Dan Penn and his bluesy suds? Maybe the details aren\'t quite right, but, in spirit, I think that listening to \\"Tearjoint\\" makes a good \\"double-dual\\" to a sad song. First point: it is not a sad song. Listen to it. Too snappy. If anything, it sounds like he\'s letting you in on a secret pleasure, a place where people go to enjoy being sad, to savor the act of crying into Budweiser. It\'s also not a song about sad songs: it\'s about the experiences of hearing sad songs, drinking beer, etc. So, it wouldn\'t make sense to call it a \\"meta\\" sad song. \\"Dual\\" is the better notion.\\n\\n\\nTo clarify: consider the space of songs and the space of feelings. There\'s a map from \\"Songs\\" to \\"Feelings\\" given by listening. When you listen to a song, that\'s an experience. As a map from \\"Songs\\" to \\"Feelings,\\" we could take listening in the dual to \\"Songs.\\" If we broaden up a bit (playing fast and lose), call that dual \\"Experiences.\\" Listening, then, is an experience, mapping sad songs to sad feelings. Then there\'s a fudge step: writing maps from \\"Experiences\\" to \\"Songs.\\" Compose that with listening, and you get back to feelings. As a map from \\"Experiences\\" (dual to songs) to \\"Feelings\\" (the base field), I think it\'s fair to put our listening/writing partnership with Penn in \\"Sad Songs Double-Dual\\" (or SS**). Here\'s a diagram:\\n\\n\\nAnyway, sometimes work comes home with you. The price of getting through the weeds is seeing sheaves in your dreams. No AG necessary to jam to Penn.\\n\\n\\n\u2013Matt\\n\\n\\n* FWIW, Quanta did an \\"explainer\\" article on sheaves earlier this week.

Man, was it a hoot. I had originally bought two tickets, but plans to find a concertmate didn\'t coagulate, so I got my money back and hit VT 113 at 6:04 PM amid rainstorms. Matt and I have talked about #endingthestigma against concert-ing single-ly; I had mentally prepared for a nice date with Kevin. However, in the Vermont fashion, standing in the merch line I spotted my friend Jenevra, and ended up hanging out with them and their nice friends the whole show. Figures.\\n\\n\\nI hadn\'t realized that W+R haven\'t performed live since before the pandemic; this Burlington show was kicking off a short tour before the Newport Folk Festival, and was their first show in quite a while. They\'ll be doing a ton more live shows following the release of their new album, Woodland, just announced and out August 23rd. There\'s a curious lack of shows in Texas (and a whole two shows in St. Paul, MN...huh). I\'ve secured mine for Dec 3 in Portland ME and already have a concertmate, so screw you poseurs.\\n\\n\\n(It had clearly been a while since touring as demonstrated by the egregious typo on the otherwise beautiful poster. Let\'s see if you can spot it (courtesy of Instagram):\\n\\n\\nUpdate: the artist posted an apology video on her IG story...\\"that is quite possibly the biggest typo/mistake I\'ve ever made, both in size and scale...I\'d just like to publicly apologize to VT...I just haven\'t slept more than four hours a night in over two weeks.\\" Apparently it passed four sets of eyes and was only caught when posted on IG)\\n\\n\\nThey seemed excited and energized to be back at it. The stage and the floor were all smiles. I love the venue, Higher Ground in S Burlington, quite a bit\u2014it\'s a very intimate setting, no seating, and no matter who you feel close and personal with the artist. I would show you a photo but there were posters on the doors that looked approximately like this:\\n\\n\\nNO PICTURES\\nNO VIDEO\\nNO RECORDING\\nNO FLASH\\nas requested by the artist\\n\\n\\nI thought it was a great idea. While I am not without sin\u2014I\'ve been seen taking a quick pic or a short video of a significant song\u2014I am usually aggrieved by the flock of phones usually present at many modern concerts. This is certainly a bit \'old man yells at cloud\' of me. I don\'t really care. Put em away.\\n\\n\\nEnough of the trivialities. The concert was incredible. I\'ve posted the setlist as remembered/scribbled by myself below, if you want spoilers. I didn\'t recognize a fair amount of songs (and was gaslighting myself into thinking I was a fake fan), but halfway through they called us good sports for listening to a bunch of songs from the new record, and songs \\"even newer than that\\" (!). \\n\\n\\nDR: \\"they\'re like the old songs...but with new words\\"\\nAudience: [laughter]\\n\\n\\nAnd yup, comparing my frantic notes to the tracklist for the new album, some I can match and some are unidentifiable. All in all I think they played something like 6 songs (6/10!) from the new record, and maybe 2 or so even newer songs. What a treat. And then those older songs\u2014they were like sitting on the porch, drawing down a fresh lemonade on a mild summer\'s evening. Couldn\'t think of anything more delightful. Most apropos to this list, their rendition of Wayside/Back in Time was my favorite I\'ve heard in hours surfing the net\u2014they brought a bass player on stage (\\"a friend of ours...he\'ll play for a few songs...he happened to be around\\" (same guy, and didn\'t realize until doing the research for this that he\'s the bass player for Punch Brothers, and so I had actually seen him live before in Burlington, but at the Flynn)), and Gillian whipped out the harmonica harness...so god dang good.\\n\\n\\nNo opener, two sets with a break, an encore, and a SECOND ENCORE (also known as an actual real encore), with an electric feel in the crowd by the conclusion. Stopped across the street at burger joint Al\'s and cruised down 89 with a milkshake and a t-shirt. Damn good night.\\n\\n\\n\u2013Kevin\\n\\n\\nOk, you can stop reading at this point if you don\'t want to hear more about the \\"buggies and the ha...\\" conspiracy I embroiled myself in. Well, I\'ve now done a special F&L on-site investigation, and the rabbit hole goes deeper.\\n\\n\\nTo review (F&L #50), in the second post-chorus to \\"Wayside/Back in Time,\\" internet sources say Welch sings \\"buggies and the hats.\\" I think it\'s \\"buggies and the hacks.\\"\\n\\n\\nFirst off, even though W+R requested no audio or video, I thought it\'d be ok to just record one tidbit, which is the clip attached to this email. At first I was thrown off as they did some rearranging, fearing they\'d cut this section, but sure enough, the lyric comes and goes. As you can hear, it illuminates nothing\u2014I swear that W+R literally leaned back from the microphone as the end of the word came round. Maddening.\\n\\n\\nHowever, I had an ace up my sleeve. I had purchased BOTH the CD and the vinyl of Soul Journey, truly desiring to own both (also the only Welch vinyl they had, which is curious considering the scarcity of SJ online). I got home and opened up the CD: no lyrics. Damn. But then I turned to the vinyl. Inside was a wonderful double spread of all the album\'s lyrics. Bingo. I anticipatorily ran my eyes down the lines, thinking up until the last second that there\'s no way practically every online source has it wrong...\\n\\n\\nI can\'t describe how satisfying this was. I literally jumped up and down.\\n\\n\\nA little post-revelation Googling revealed more that I somehow hadn\'t found in my initial red-stringing. \\"Buggies and the hacks\\" is a line from \\"Little Sadie,\\" a American folk murder ballad; specifically in a verse in the first recorded version by early banjo player/folk singer Clarence Ashley.\\n\\n\\nI woke next morning at a half past nine\\nThe buggies and the hacks all swarmed in line\\nThe gents and the gamblers standing around\\nI\'m going to take Sadie to her burying ground\\n\\n\\nClarence Ashley was rediscovered in the \'60s during the folk revival, having been featured on the influential collection Anthology of American Folk Music in 1952.

I was a little preoccupied putting together those AG talks that I mentioned, so I was glad to have folks who could pick up the slack while I shirked my duties. That\'s done now. I gave the second talk yesterday. Watch it if you feel like learning something, or if you like watching guys in snap-button shirts talk slowly.\\n\\n\\nThat should be the last time I have to present anything this summer. Focus returns to higher priorities. We have another guest feature coming up on Sunday, but, for now, I\'m taking the reins. I set aside plenty of time today to sit, listen, absorb and reflect. We\'re returning to an F&L staple: queen of the scene, Emmylou Harris. We\'ll hear one of my favorite songs from her, off one of her best albums \u2014 an important piece of the F&L arc.\\n\\n\\nAs an editorial comment: even on a low-stakes platform, I feel some pressure when I get to one of my favorite songs. There are no losers, no fillers on the list (from my perspective), but there are, as there must be, some that stand above the rest. Some songs need extra emphasis, extra loft, distinction to match their caliber.\\nI don\'t want to let the song down. It\'s a challenge that I could tackle two ways: minimally or maximally. The minimal approach would be to put it out there with less commentary, less contextualization. Let it meet you on its own terms. The other approach, the approach today, rests on additivity \u2014 forming a mountain, not filling a hole. Knowing part of my context won\'t stop you from building your own. If you\'re on the email chain, as opposed to just following the playlist, I\'d think you\'d want the context. Ideally, my associations can jump-start yours. I\'m trying to lift a song out of the stream and give you a chance to make it your own. See how it goes.\\n_______________________________\\n\\n\\nSong #78: \\"Tennessee Rose\\"\\nWho Made it: Emmylou Harris\\nYear: 1981\\n_______________________________\\n\\n\\nThoughts: \\"Tennessee Rose\\" worked its way into my blood last winter (Feb, 2023). I\'d reached the point in Harris-appreciation where I was trying to hear everything. \\"Rose\\" closes Cimmaron, an album with covers of both Springsteen and Van Zandt. I played it through the spring. By summer, when I was back in Wyoming, I couldn\'t shake it. \\n\\n\\nTwo \\"Rose\\" memories stand out from that summer. The first was in O\'Dwyer\'s, playing pool \u2014 standard evening fare when I\'m back home. They have one of those app-controlled jukeboxes. I was jonesin\' for \\"Rose,\\" but didn\'t have my phone with me, so had to convince my brother to get on the app and queue it up. Danny was resistant. He doesn\'t share my taste and doesn\'t like requests. I had to convince him with a standard bargain from our childhood: put it on, and I\'d let him punch me in the shoulder. He agreed. The punch was solid, but the speakers were quiet. I could hardly hear the song.\\n\\n\\nThe second memory was on the first day of my drive from Laramie to Houston. I had a bunch of albums downloaded to pass the time, and Cimmaron came up after about 200 miles. I was coming down 285, on the high bend above South Park. Scenic view. Far from Tennessee, but hearing \\"Rose\\" while I looked over that big summer valley felt pretty special. I\'m sure I was singing along.\\n\\n\\nWhen you listen to \\"Rose,\\" you need to hear the start. Make sure your headphones are connected, volume is right, etc. Maybe go a little louder than you usually do, as a treat. Hear the descending motif: one, two, three, four, five. Hank Devito, who co-wrote the song, plays pedal. The bass slides along, bolstering, then the first handoff goes to Skaggs on fiddle. Skaggs responds to DeVito and adds a few flourishes. The fiddles and pedal, vocal instruments, step back, clearing space for Harris\' doubling: \\n\\n\\nWell it\'s a sweet dream\\nThat keeps me close to you, dear\\nAnd it\'s a sad thing,\\nWhen we\'re apart I\'m blue, dear\\n\\n\\nListen to how the fiddle uses its last notes to match Harris\' sweet dream. Smooth joinery, all around. That\'s a band in step.\\n\\n\\nKeeping with tradition, I tried to chart the song. See below.\\n\\n\\nThe real punch of \\"Rose\\" comes in its twin choruses, sandwiched around an instrumental. The motif from the opening measures returns, stronger and fuller. Hear how it puts the words in bold, makes them pointed, exact.  It\u2019s open and deliberate, brave and simple. The instrumental, the valley between peaks, gives you time to consider. Then, in the second chorus, the message comes back,verbatim, with a perfect transition from the fiddle:\\n\\n\\nTake this love I am giving\\nFor it\'s truly the lasting kind\\nThe gift I hold is believing\\nThat you will always be mine\\n\\n\\nIt\'s worth thinking, here, about what goes where. It\'s clear that \'this love\' goes out, from the singer to the subject. Or, at least, that\'s the request \u2014 love offered is not always love received. \'Take this love,\' an imperative, suggests a slew of questions: is this love clear? is this love balanced? As I hear it, there\'s an underlying fear that no expression, no statement, no gift ever means to the recipient what the giver needs it to. There\'s some inevitable gap between intent and effect.\\nIn even the most mundane things \u2014 at work, in school \u2014 we want to be understood. How much greater, then, is that desire, that necessity, in the least mundane things \u2014 in art, in love? To understand ourselves is hard enough; to make ourselves understood may be impossible. The central question, the central frustration, is whether we can bridge that gap, and whether we should want to. Consider:\\n\\n\\nAnd there are times\\nThat only heaven knows\\nHow I love my Tennessee rose\\n\\n\\nIs that a happy line, or a sad one? I could see it either way. On the sad side: don\u2019t we deserve to know our own love? And shouldn\u2019t we find the right way to share it? The other view, maybe, boils down to faith in big things, things beyond our reach. Why ground an ideal?  Even the best writing is finite. If it fits in words, or in your head, it can\'t be so grand. It\'s better, then, to have something too great to say, too great to know. Let Heaven win.\\n\\n\\nTo settle the question, I went to a primary source. The smile, I think, says it all.\\n\\n\\nAs for what goes where, I\'m convinced that the gift, distinct from this love, stays put. It\'s her own to hold and follow, a fixed point of reference. To hold that gift of believing, something constant, something outside convention, means a lot. Keep those gifts close.\\n\\n\\nIn summary: giving, taking, holding, believing, fussing, loving, etc. \u2014 get after it.\\n\\n\\n\u2013Matt","artistWiki":"https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=123572","albumWiki":"https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=3926295","relatedArtists":{"album":["Brian Ahern","Joe Allen","Mike Bowden","Tony Brown","Barry Burton","James Burton","Charles Cochran","Donivan Cowart","Hank DeVito","Steve Fishell","Wayne Goodwin","Emory Gordy Jr.","Glen Hardin","Emmylou Harris","Don Johnson","Paul Kennerley","David Kirby","Albert Lee","Kenny Malone","Herb Pedersen","Mickey Raphael","Frank Reckard","Ricky Skaggs","Buddy Spicher","Fayssoux Starling","Barry Tashian","John Ware","Cheryl White","Sharon White","Don Williams"],"other":["Brian Ahern","Paul Kennerley","Emmylou Harris","James Burton","Ricky Skaggs","Barry Tashian","Don Williams"]}},{"number":79,"song":"Heart on a String","artist":"Jason Isbell and the 400 Unit","album":"Here We Rest","spotifyLink":"https://open.spotify.com/track/3DXGP7NK1bYPlGo1nw3cnW","textBody":"7-27-2024: Heart on a String\\n\\n\\nJason Isbell spent some mutually formative time with the Drive-By Truckers.

According to legend, it was the song that pushed George out of Mothers of Invention, and there have been 3 theories as to why: (1) Zappa fired him because he felt George should have his own band if he was capable of writing a song as beautiful as \\"Willin\u2019\\"; (2) Zappa fired him for playing a 15-minute guitar solo with his amp off; (3) Zappa fired him because the song contains drug references. I choose to ignore (3) \u2014 George cooked himself out of a job and was probably kind of annoying at rehearsals. He went on to form Little Feat (with Zappa\u2019s keyboardist, no less) and never looked back. The name is a reference to George\u2019s alleged small feet and they spelled it F-E-A-T as an homage to the B-E-A-T-L-E-S.\\n\\n\\n\\"Willin\u2019\\" is a trucker\u2019s anthem. The lyrics speak for themselves, there\u2019s not much to decipher. But it\u2019s an interesting exercise to think about where the driver is from: if you connect the dots from Tehachapi--\x3eTonopah--\x3eTucson--\x3eTucumcari, you end up marching West-East across the American Southwest towards Dallas. Is Alice waiting for him there like Brandy of Looking Glass fame (I guess truckers are kinda like modern day sailors)? Is she even real? We don\u2019t know and that\u2019s part of the \\"Willin\u2019\\" experience. \\n\\n\\nI adore this song, and it taps into the special loneliness of being out on the road on your own. I think that\u2019s why so many people feel a human-like connection to their cars/trucks \u2014 I certainly do. You are alone, ungrounded and in transit, but you are also forced to think and be extremely present. It\u2019s kind of a \\"Born to Run\\" sentiment, and there\u2019s a freedom that comes with that loneliness. Being our current age can feel a lot like getting behind the wheel of a rig and just heading west and looking for signs to keep moving or stop. Next time you\u2019re on the road, queue this one up. With the rhythm of the road beneath you, you\u2019ll be serenaded by George\u2019s crooning slide guitar riffs and tasty alliterations to certain contemplative consequences.\\n\\n\\n\u2013Nick","artistWiki":"https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=784611","albumWiki":"https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=1043265","relatedArtists":{"album":["Lowell George","Bill Payne","Roy Estrada","Richie Hayward","Milt Holland","Sneaky Pete Kleinow","Debbie Lindsey","Ron Elliott"],"other":["Lowell George","Roy Estrada","Bill Payne","Richie Hayward"]}},{"number":81,"song":"Sunshine (Go Away Today)","artist":"Jonathan Edwards","album":"Jonathan Edwards","spotifyLink":"https://open.spotify.com/track/3Xd39NB1rifow2RDNVgSFp","textBody":"7-29-2024: Sunshine (Go Away Today)\\n\\n\\n_______________________________\\n\\n\\nSong #81: \\"Sunshine (Go Away Today)\\"\\nWho Made it: Jonathan Edwards\\nYear: 1971\\n_______________________________\\n\\n\\nThoughts: \\"One-hit-wonder\\" is an unkind and reductive term. But, there are some folks who wind up with one song more well-known and thoroughly-played than the rest of their discography. That\'s the case with Jonathan Edwards and \\"Sunshine.\\" As he said (somewhat bitterly) on the Barry Richards Rock Show, \\"This is the song that made me famous.\\" It\'s a song, like \\"Margaritaville,\\" that I heard enough on the oldies station growing up to learn the words and decide I liked it. I have it saved on eighteen different playlists, starting with \\"Something super distinctive bruh\\" (made in 2016 to impress a girl I\'d been snapchatting) and up through my 2023 top one-hundred (not linked, for fear of spoilers). It\'s a standard.\\n\\n\\nFor most of my years with \\"Sunshine,\\" it was \u2014 for me, as for many people \u2014 the only Edwards song I knew. I was surprised, while I lived in Maine, to see a poster in town advertising an upcoming concert. JE was coming to the Chocolate Church. I recognized his name, thought about \\"Sunshine,\\" and bought a ticket.\\n\\n\\nIt\'s odd to meet the body behind a voice. I think about seeing Bruce Springsteen live, or Steve Earle, and matching the men on stage to all the videos I\'d seen, articles I\'d read, and songs I\'d sung. Seeing them in person felt surprising in the same way it felt surprising the first time I drove from Wyoming to New Hampshire: I knew that roads went all the way between, but I didn\'t accept it until I drove them. I knew that real people were behind the songs, but the truth didn\'t settle in my gut until I could have thrown a can and hit them.\\n\\n\\nDistant and heroic as they were, I was much more aware of Springteen and Earle\'s personhood before their concerts than I was with Edwards\'. I\'d seen hundreds of Springsteen videos on YouTube, up through the modern era, so I at least knew what he\'d look like. Likewise for Earle. For Edwards, though, the only intel I had before the show was about a thousand listens to \\"Sunshine\\" and his picture on the cover \u2014 young, jaunty, mustachioed. I was headed into the show (mostly) blind.\\n\\n\\nIt was a disorienting, revealing experience* \u2014 much more so than with acts I knew well \u2014 to see him walk out on stage. He was old. He had two canes, and he played a great show. All the old people in the audience loved him, and they knew his songs. They had requests. Of course, he played \\"Sunshine,\\" and everyone loved it. It\'s a great song. But, they didn\'t only love it, and I didn\'t either. I don\'t now.  I love \\"Sometimes\\"; I love \\"Emma\\"; I love \\"Dream Song.\\" They\'re not \\"Sunshine,\\" but they could have been.\\n\\n\\nSo, give some time to the wonders, and catch a show with the old folks. Good stuff out there under the hits.\\n\\n\\n\u2013Matt\\n\\n\\n*For the sake of journalistic integrity, I\'ll admit that I\'d also partaken in some of the Mid-Coast\'s finest beforehand, which might have colored my perception.","artistWiki":"https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=37194","albumWiki":"https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=52077","relatedArtists":{"album":[],"other":["Jonathan Edwards"]}},{"number":82,"song":"Play a Train Song","artist":"Todd Snider","album":"East Nashville Skyline","spotifyLink":"https://open.spotify.com/track/3sAZAmtqVK6aQvwJaujBsd","textBody":"7-30-2024: Play a Train Song\\n\\n\\n_______________________________\\n\\n\\nSong #82: \\"Play a Train Song\\"\\nWho Made it: Todd Snider\\nYear: 2004\\n_______________________________\\n\\n\\nThoughts: Transportation\'s back. We could chart some sort of family tree: road songs, trail songs, horses, boats, trains. We\'ll not get into the weeds today about whether \\"Play a Train Song\\" is itself a train song, dual to one, adjoint, or whatever else. It\'s got a trainlike rhythm, whistlin\' harmonica, and good momentum. It makes it what it is.\\n\\n\\nThis is our first (and only) song from Todd Snider. He has a knack for narrative and a varied catalogue: some serious, some funny, many mixed. Contrast a tough-listen like \\"You Think You Know Somebody\\" with a novelty track like \\"Beer Run.\\"* Somewhere between those two, there\'s \\"Train Song.\\" The first verse tends toward lampoon, poking fun at a certain sort of macho, coarse, country lovin\' jerk. You might know a few, or at least know the type. They\'d make easy targets for a couple more ragging verses, but Snyder pivots. The second verse, sung from the shouter\'s perspective, puts some depth behind the clich\xe9s:\\n\\n\\nI got this old black leather jacket, I got this pack of Marlboro Reds**\\nI got this stash here in my pocket, I got these thoughts in my own head\\nThe right to run until I\'ve gotta walk or until I\'ve got to crawl\\nThis moment that I\'m in right now and nothing else at all\\n\\n\\nThat\'s a great verse, and one I\'d say takes a fair shot at summarizing the \\"Country Mindset\\" (or at least one particular country mindset). Snyder explained live in 2007 that \\"Train Song\\" is about a friend of his who passed away \u2014 a friend who loved train songs. With some perspective, you see less of a jerk and more of a man in the midst of living. Joy in freedom and simple grit are as much a part of it as whiskey and Reds. You can take any of those things and twist it into something nasty, which plenty of country acts have done, but they\'re not nasty in essence. \\n\\n\\nWe like trains because they\'re bold, fast, and loud. It takes a lot to stop them. In fine moments, we feel the same: runaway, but not run-down. We\'re headed for good trouble, for smoke and breath and glory. Coal runs low but the boots stay on.\\n\\n\\n\u2013Matt\\n\\n\\n*My Uncle Joe used to sing the \\"Beer Run\\" chorus (\'B, double E, double R, U, N\') at barbecues and get-togethers. I thought it was a song he made up, and felt sort of sad when I learned it wasn\'t. You\'ll notice that Robert Earl Keen (F&L #11) plays a central part in \\"Beer Run.\\" To close a loop, REK also has a great cover of \\"Train Song\\".\\n\\n\\n**AKA \\"Cowboy Killers.\\" Sound off in the comments: how many syllables are in the word \\"Marlboro\\" ?","artistWiki":"https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=1199549","albumWiki":"https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=24743838","relatedArtists":{"album":[],"other":["Todd Snider"]}},{"number":83,"song":"The Whiskey Makes You Sweeter","artist":"Laure Cantrell","album":"Not The Tremblin\' Kind","spotifyLink":"https://open.spotify.com/track/7C1kGvBohd6r1dXyVN1K7M","textBody":"7-31-2024: The Whiskey Makes You Sweeter\\n\\n\\n_______________________________\\n\\n\\nSong #83: \\"The Whiskey Makes You Sweeter\\"\\nWho Made it: Laura Cantrell\\nYear: 2000\\n_______________________________\\n\\n\\nThoughts: Adding some quietness to the mix. The song, like the titular liquid, takes an edge off. No sour notes here. Compare \\"TWMYS\\" to \\"Flatness\\" (F&L #14), which treads similar ground with harsher tones. They\'re two songs dealing with the perils of drink, but at different levels: one to the point of unrestraint, the other to oblivion.\\n\\n\\nIt gets me thinking about barriers to action, and how we get around ourselves. Folks are crafty. We pull tricks, present forcing future. This could be good: maybe you want to run ten miles, but you get tired after five. When you run near home, you give up early. Instead, one day, you run five miles straight out while you still feel good. By the time you\'re tired, you\'ve sealed the deal. You have to run back. You curse yourself the whole way, but you\'re stuck \u2014 sort of like the old \\"don\'t open the door\\" bit, or the Hot Rod pool scene.\\n\\n\\nOften as not, though, we trick ourselves the wrong way. Maybe you\'ve got a bad habit you\'re trying to kick, or a good one you\'re trying to build. In the right state of mind, you stick to your commitment. How do you fail? Put yourself in the wrong state of mind \u2014 deliberately, if failing\'s what you want. Think dominos: you\'re not willing (or not able) to push the big one, but you\'ll tap the little guy and let the rest follow. We see it in \\"TWMYS\\":\\n\\n\\nI started slow and steady, I went from Cola to a beer\\nI made a resolution from the liquor I\'d steer clear\\nWhen I saw you there, somethin\' inside of me switched off\\nAnd when I switched to the whiskey, then I knew that I was gone\\n\\n\\nThe subpar beau doesn\'t warrant sober attention. But, he\'s not too far removed. In the absence of a better option, and with chemically lowered standards, he seems alright. He\'s not a figure with much action in the song: he walks, charmless, into the bar. There\'s enough spark to catch the narrator\'s attention, but she needs some gas to make it burn. Thus, the whiskey. Let \'er rip.\\n\\n\\n\u2013Matt\\n\\n\\nReply from Eli Bryant:\\n\\n\\nThe next time I want to quit on a run when I start seeing stars, I\'ll remember the toughness Rod showed that day at the pool...and the one in a million chance that Isla Fisher could pass by on her kangaroo and resuscitate me to save the day. That\'ll be enough.\\n\\n\\nJokes aside, what a great addition to the F&L list. I know the \\"boom-chika\\" rhythm is a dime a dozen in the country music world, but paired with a smooth voice, well-timed walks between chords, and a tasteful guitar break (2:31), mmm... don\'t need much else to get me bobbing.\\n\\n\\nAs for yesterday\'s question, you\'ll usually only get two syllables out of me. My tendency to mumble makes it come out \\"mar-bro\\".

I might finish this weekend \u2014 many pages, but they don\'t take long. Please refrain from spoilers. It\'s had me thinking about buying land and about this song. \\"Tecumseh Valley\\" feels Steinbeckian, with death and valleys and ancient professions. Both shine with/under the \\"hard flat light of the West.\\" * Both cut me raw.\\n\\n\\nI went back and forth over which version of \\"Tecumseh\\" to choose. Restricting to studio recordings, there\'s the 1968 version from \\"For the Sake of the Song\\" and the 1969 version on \\"Our Mother the Mountain.\\" Feel free to disagree, but I went with 1969 for a few reasons:\\n1. Tempo and Tone: 1968 is brighter and faster than 1969. Those aren\'t marks against \'68, but it changes the mood. Some things take a while. As a rule of thumb, I think that complex songs (with respect to lyrics and subject) ought to go slower, while simple ones (like yesterday\'s) need some speed. It\'s the same with beef: tougher cuts need time, low and slow, to make them taste best.\\n2. Expert Opinions: There are a slew of covers of \\"Tecumseh,\\" including one from Steve Earle, another from Jason Isbell, and a live performance from The Flatlanders (Jimmie Dale Gilmore, Joe Ely, and Butch Hancock).** In their renditions, you can tell that \'69, not \'68, was the template. They know their stuff. Why should I question the \\"canonical\\" choice?\\n3. Writer\'s Intent: If you write a song, record it one way, then (less than a year later) release a new album with a new recording, what\'s that say? If TVZ thought he could improve on \'68, I\'ll trust him. The \'69 cut does sound more honest, like the song he\'d wanted to make but hadn\'t quite nailed. It\'s whittled down and cleaner \u2014 a strong second draft. Trust revision.\\nAnyway, the \\"final\\" choice is symbolic. It\'s best to listen to both, and then some more. I like the sad, sad violin that shows up on this one, and the praise from future fusser-and-lover Nanci Griffith on this one. I don\'t have time to dig into them all, so I\'ll just say a few things about \'69.\\n\\n\\nPay attention to the instrument playing on the right-hand side (assuming you set your sound to stereo). It might just be a guitar, but I think it\'s a dobro. Whatever it is, it\'s doing heavy work. Right at 0:29, it bends down and knocks me out. It splits the best line in the song:\\n\\n\\nWell her ways were free\\nAnd it seemed to me\\nThat sunshine walked beside her.\\n\\n\\nIf someone comes to mind there, keep \'em close. Sunshine folks are special. The dobro keeps moaning, and the harmonica calls back from the other side. Townes and the bass take the center lane. His intonation on \'Tecumseh\' at 2:08 is another highlight. And all those sounds support a vivid, weary, lonesome story \u2014 form and function mastered. What else would you expect from the best?\\n\\n\\n\u2013Matt\\n\\n\\n* Quote from Ch 15 in EoE. Spencer and Tecumseh are just outside Oklahoma City, which we\'ll count as part of the West.\\n\\n\\n** I like the Flatlander\'s version, because you can hear beer bottles clinking and people playing pool in the background. I also like the album cover. The terrier looks a lot like my old dog, Cleo.

I don\'t mind. I like them. It\'s a luxury to focus. But, it affects my mood. That\'s doubly true on the weekends, when I type in the morning. Maybe that\'s why I went for \\"Tecumseh Valley\\" last night, so I could sleep off the looped tragedy. Save something warm for Saturday.\\n\\n\\nHere\'s what\'s warm: \\"817 Oakland Avenue.\\" I don\'t know how the address figures into things. You could probably google to figure it out. I\'m a fan of abstruse titles and little puzzles, so I\'ll leave it alone. It must mean something to Charlie.\\n\\n\\nAll the sonic richness comes from a flurry of strings and a single thumping drum. It sounds like maybe an open tuning, where notes ring together by default. Parr plays a 12-string, so everything\'s doubled. It\'s a good example of skill concealing effort: the sound is so fluid, so unforced, you\'d think you\'re hearing the strings play each other, tossing notes back and forth. If a guitar came to life when you left the room, Toy-Story style, it might sound like this.\\n\\n\\nIt feels good \u2014 fortifying, clarifying, kind \u2014 to sit with this one. Parr sings in questions and commands: part performance, part sermon, part quiz. It\'s not a song that falls into the background. You hear it and engage. Have you? Do you? Will you? Action is optional; thought is not.\\n\\n\\nThe joy in \\"817\\" is not the sudden, heady sort. It\'s more hard won. When we have some personal triumph, some stroke of luck or deserved success, the joy is sharp. It makes us bold and tall. It freshens the air. The worry, though, is that those joys won\'t last, or are upward blips on a downward trend. When the rush dies down, we want reassurance \u2014 reassurance that our happy new towers stand on solid ground. The distrust of ground takes time to arrive, and more time to beat. I think it\'s why, as folks get older, they spend (or should spend) less time working for themselves and more time for others. Foundation is something we share, and we won\'t trust it unless we bend down and build it ourselves. \\n\\n\\nOf course, working for others (not as an employee, but as a partner) comes with its own fears. You worry that, if you mess up, it\'s not just yourself that you\'ll bring down. There\'s comfort in confining incompetence. I\'ve thought about this a lot as I\'ve gone from teaching (very external) back to being a student (very internal). Then, it bothered me that I had no time for self-improvement. I felt skills slipping that I\'d worked hard to build, and I worried that any failure on my part would compound in the folks around me. Now, most of my work goes toward myself, so the pressure feels greater to have something to show for it \u2014 no excuses.\\n\\n\\nIt seems like a \\"pick-your-poison\\" issue, but that (I hope) is another side-effect of local perception. Averaging over self and others, years gone by, in and out, smooths the bumps. Parr\'s \\"817\\" feels sure of an upward trend, fueled by honest good effort and compassion. That\'s the sort of stable joy, earned and lasting, that we need most. Take some to heart and spread it around, do.\\n\\n\\n\u2013Matt","artistWiki":"https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=7080397","albumWiki":"https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=7080397","relatedArtists":{"album":[],"other":["Charlie Parr"]}},{"number":87,"song":"Lodi","artist":"Creedence Clearwater Revival","album":"Green River","spotifyLink":"https://open.spotify.com/track/1Ay5MiilZj2ZGQLeTWVJ6o","textBody":"8-4-2024: Lodi\\n\\n\\n_______________________________\\n\\n\\nSong #87: \\"Lodi\\"\\nWho Made it: Creedence Clearwater Revival\\nYear: 1969\\n_______________________________\\n\\n\\nThoughts: Big name. Points to you if you had \\"CCR Cameo\\" on your F&L bingo. \\"Lodi\\" tops our rankings so far in terms of play count. \\"A Pirate Looks at Forty\\" and \\"Willin\'\\" round out the top three. Expect no special treatment. Fogerty & Co. get the same berth as the Mark Joneses and Oxes here. An amateur mailing list makes a great equalizer.\\n\\n\\nWhere to put \\"Lodi\\" in our spread? Maybe, by nature, I\'ve focused on extremes: very sad, very happy.  I reflect what\'s available. Bg emotions inspire more songs. But, most days aren\'t big, unless you buy into the whole \\"small is big and normal is extraordinary\\" racket. Drawing on prior material, I\'ll cite F&L #47. It\'s High, Low And In Between (no oxford, quotes omitted, capitalization retained). Between is part of it, else we wouldn\'t need the And. \\"Lodi\\" is between.\\n\\n\\nAdd another branch to the tree of road songs: stuck songs. We\'ll hear more. Lodi, i.e. the land of spinning wheels and twiddling thumbs, might as well be purgatory. You spend a lot of time on the way on the way to anywhere [sic]. Maybe, at best, you get about 70% of the gettin\' got that you\'d like to get, and that\'s at best. Best is rare, as is worse. Lodi is common.\\n\\n\\nIt\'s poor metaphorical alignment (anatomically), but \\"Chin up, Head down\\" makes a good baseline. Build on that, or dig under \u2014your call, in intent if not effect.

I can\'t say how many pack-years* passed for frontman Ben Nichols in the interim, but his voice on \\"T&T\\" suggests a few.\\n\\n\\nI didn\'t link any live material for \\"Little Silver Heart\\" back in May. I\'ll fix that now. Here\'s a good performance ripped from a documentary that came out in 2005. Great terrible haircut on Nichols. The way he yells makes me think it wasn\'t just the cigs that built the vocal patina on \\"T&T.\\" He doesn\'t seem to mind the strain. He\'s not saving anything. It\'s a snapshot of a band in their early days. You can tell that the guitarist internalized Skynyrd, and almost hear him break into \\"Sweet Home Alabama\\" a few times. They\'ve all got energy, but not much restraint. It takes a while for them to figure out how not to step on each other\'s toes during the mid-song spanking story \u2014 just let me have it, fellas. I\'m sure they re-hashed the finer points of stage banter after their set.\\n\\n\\nCompare the \\"LSH\\" video to this recording of \\"T&T\\" from 2021. The bassist and guitarist look sleepy, but Nichols rocks the same white t-shirt and jeans combo. Still playful, still quick to grin. They add a bridge to the live version, post solo, that ups the wallop:\\n\\n\\nThese arms of mine\\nThere\'s pain in my heart\\nThe Tennessee nights\\nThe Texas dark\\n\\n\\nIt\'s a tender song when you get down to it, gruffness notwithstanding. The studio version has a clearer piano part and some tasteful horns.

Parisians continued to call on her aid after she passed, including for protection from floods \u2014 thus the line in \\"Tear.\\"\\n\\n\\nWhy was Farrar so well versed in 5\u1d57\u02b0 century French saints? When Son Volt was starting out, he was based in St. Louis, Missouri. An hour\'s drive away is the town of Ste. Genevieve. \\n\\n\\nWhether the French Canadians who named the settlement had a cruel sense of irony or were hoping for divine protection is unclear, but Ste.

He seems like a gruff softie with bad jokes and good hugs. In \\"retirement,\\" he took up a hobby \u2014 guitar building. Check out this video to hear him describe the interplay between crafting instruments and songs. If you look at the table in the opening shot, you can see an ashtray that was a gift from Emmylou Harris and a Randall Knife. Later, there\'s a picture of TVZ hanging on the wall. Touching stuff.

Old No. 1 came out when Clark was only thirty-three. Still, his Grandpa energy was brewing. It might be part of the reason why he sounds authoritative. To be clear: the \'old time feeling\' isn\'t just the feeling of being old, but the two aren\'t disjoint.\\n\\n\\n\\"Old Time\\" shares its slow seriousness with the other Clark song we\'ve heard (\\"She Ain\'t Going Nowhere,\\" F&L #28). Lest you think that\'s all there is to the man, listen to \\"A Nickle for the Fiddler,\\" which is sandwhiched between \\"Nowhere\\" and \\"Oldtime.\\" It\'s not so serious. I almost wrote about \\"Nickle\\" instead of \\"Old Time,\\" but I couldn\'t figure out what a \'freaky apple pie\' was. So, I gave up.\\n\\n\\nPies aside, \\"Old Time\\" has plenty of meat. Tick...tock...tick...tock... out of the gate. \\"And\\" is a good choice of first word, despite what grammar losers say. It makes it sound like you\'re picking up an ongoing conversation, circling back to the usual subjects. The song, if it wanted, could last much longer. It\'s steady in the sense of season and cycles, phases and stages, moving along to get where it was. Guy pipes up for the title line then hushes back down.\\n\\n\\nClark never defines \'that old time feeling.\' He says what it does and what it\'s like, but never what it is. \\n\\n\\nAnd that old time feeling\\nRocks, and spits, and cries\\nLike an old lover remembering\\nThe girl with the clear blue eyes\\n\\n\\nWe\'re back in the Yoneda school of songwriting. Clark is smart enough to know that he couldn\'t say what he means out right, nor would we accept something explicit. But, he\'s not lazy. We\'re not dumb. The point comes across, even if we don\'t have experience with winter-cats and winos and blues-men and bars. Clark\'s vignettes corner his feeling; his feeling fills the vignettes. We hear them feel the start of something that drags up our own associations, our own vignettes. Once we have those, we have the feeling.\\n\\n\\nWrite your own down. Mine wouldn\'t have an old salesman kicking, but it\'d have a coach in a windbreaker and khakis. No man with his checkers, but a fold-up softwood chess set.

He\'s trying; he can\'t; he\'ll never. All that stricture, via harmonica, goes into one bright, vital tune. It\'s a sprint. Admittedly, it\'s also obsessive. Listen with forgiving ears. I think he\'s in on it: hyperbolic devotion. The backing \'ahhhhh ahhhh ahhhh\'s sound like a wink, a grain of salt. \\n\\n\\nStill, some parts need no hemming.

JT took to music, played in bands, and made eight albums between 2008 and 2019. He died in 2020.\\n\\n\\nWhen I went to the Steve Earle concert in July, it was plain how much he missed his son. They were family and bandmates. Steve spoke about JT, his life and music. He also talked about his death. He wanted folks to know, because knowing might save someone: fentanyl killed his son. It\'s not what JT meant to take, but it\'s what he got. Steve was explicit about that. There\'s a video here where he makes about the same speech and sings one of Justin\'s songs (\\"Harlem River Blues\\"). It\'s a hard watch, but the message is important: \\"It\'s out there, it is fucking dangerous, and it\'s in everything. So be careful.\\"\\n\\n\\nThere\'s more you can read about JT. I like this profile in GQ. Like I\'ve said, I\'m not equipped for biography. I just wanted to put enough down for some context, to help Steve get his message out, and to draw a few more connections backstage. It\'s a tight scene.

That\'s a milestone. By now, we have a good sense of \\"the sound\\" and the main players in the amorphous country/rock/folk/blues borderlands. I\'ve been full of praise and admiration. But, you can only say so many nice things before they start to sound canned. I like these songs \u2014that\'s not in question. At this point, though, I\'ve got enough of a base put down to go on offense. The time is right to critique.\\n\\n\\nWhat\'s my gripe with \\"Cowgirl in the Sand\\"? None, but that it exposes a shortcoming. When I was putting this list together, Neil Young was still boycotting Spotify. I put The Byrds\'s version of \\"Cowgirl\\" on the list. As The Byrd\'s play it, it\'s a fine song. It would be right at home here. It fits better than Young\'s original with the sound we\'re used to. Why\'d I switch it, then? It\'s good, but it\'s too small. They took Neil\'s ten minute hulk and cut it down to a pretty 3:20. That\'s my first real complaint about \\"alt-country\\": there aren\'t enough big songs.\\n\\n\\nIt could have been different. Young was in the water. His \\"Cowgirl\\" came out in 1969, one year after The Byrds put out Sweetheart of the Rodeo and the same year that Gram Parsons and the Burrito Brothers made Gilded Palace of Sin. Seeds were planted. Norms were defined. When the trend-setters were picking and choosing, deciding what limbs they\'d cut from tradition to assemble their franken-genre, they left awe in the scrap bin. They left big to rock.\\n\\n\\nI\'ll come in with some disclaimers: obviously, not every song should be ten minutes long. Not every song needs a handful of solos. There\'s merit in humility and simplicity and all those down-home virtues, but I wish more folks in this neck of the woods would lean into some self-aggrandizement. We\'ve only had three songs so far over the six minute mark \u2014not enough. There\'ll be more, but not too many. I could have gone out of my way to skew things, but there just aren\'t that many big country songs to choose from. Bigness shouldn\'t be genre specific. That\'s a loss.\\n\\n\\nWhat I mean is something about raising the upper bound of what we can expect. Nine times out of ten, I want a tight, honest, polished song with no fat to trim. I want something that zooms in and shows me a little glint of myself. I want the well-worn, dog-eared book in my pocket. The other time, though, I want the opus. I want a song that grows and tackles life in total, that goes unashamed after glory. The big songs, the long songs, are hardly ever that song, but they\'re evidence of good-faith attempts. The masters of country seem to know too well that they can\'t put everything in a song, so don\'t. Guy Clark probably never wanted to write \\"Jungleland.\\" Still, I would have loved to hear him try.\\n\\n\\nAll I mean is that a little more Crazy Horse couldn\'t hurt.

I don\'t think they played \\"James River Blues,\\" but they did sing Barrett\'s Privateers. I\'m glad someone recorded. I was out there belting it out, but I might have been the only one. The rest of the crowd didn\'t seem to pick up on the call-and-response \u2014 not even \'god damn them all.\' Maybe we were just too far from Halifax. I give frontman Ketch Secor kudos for maintaining energy in the face of a confused crowd. It reminds me of my first year teaching when I played guitar and my roommate sang \\"American Pie\\" during a school assembly. The kids were good sports, but the faculty gave us flack for cutting 8 minutes into lunch. Art is hard.\\n_______________________________\\n\\n\\nSong #97: \\"James River Blues\\"\\nWho Made it: Old Crow Medicine Show\\nYear: 2006\\n_______________________________\\n\\n\\nThoughts: No folk-hero carries more clout in alt-country circles than John Henry. Gillian Welch*, Steve Earle, Drive-By Truckers, Songs: Ohia, and Justin Townes Earle all have Henry-inspired songs \u2014 there are more to count if you include covers of the traditional tune. Steve Earle even named his youngest son \\"John Henry.\\" And though \\"JRB\\" doesn\'t mention the hero explicitly, I count it among the Henry songs. It\'s another case of confronting obsolescence and the awful news of something coming along to make life \\"easy.\\"\\n\\n\\nTo quote GW, \'[think about] how happy John Henry was that he fell down dying.\' She points out, rightly, that working hard is joyful, especially when there\'s an easier way to do the job. We regular folk ought not John Henry ourselves. Leave that to the folk-legends. But, dialing back, consider a Henry-esque ego-death.\\n\\n\\nI\'ll explain what I mean. You\'re all busy people, working and living and growing and learning. With days as short as they are, it can get to feeling like every minute matters (in a bad sense). It \u2014 the thoroughly documented productivity trap \u2014 eats at your peace of mind. When can you rest? The times when I fully relax, when I don\'t feel the need to do anything, are times when I\'ve nearly John-Henry\'ed myself on some low stakes, high difficulty task. Labor is best.\\n\\n\\nExample one: I used to go on long skis at Pineland farms. Not as long as some of the freaks on this list, but long for me. Afterward, no indulgence felt unearned. I\'d buy a kombucha. I\'d take a half hour shower. I\'d grate two blocks of Cabot onto a tray of nachos and eat it on the couch. I\'d live unbothered. It\'s a Maslowian life-hack: run the tank to empty (i.e. upset the base condition) and your brain forgets its high-level, long-term concerns. It\'s in the same vein as a trick I used to use when I couldn\'t sleep. When worries kept me up at 3am, I\'d go outside and stand there until I got really cold. Then, I\'d go back in and knock right out. Try it.**\\n\\n\\nExample two: Kevin wrote (F&L 50) a bit about our time working together on the trails in New Hampshire. Other summers, I worked with Sean, Will, Osman, Eric, and Michael. We\'d weekend at the Lodge, then camp on-site (or nearby) while we worked. Those were smelly, itchy, exhausting weeks. But, nothing felt better than getting back to the lodge on Friday afternoon, cracking a shower beer, and sitting down to dinner \u2014 the best of good times.\\n\\n\\nMaybe \\"ego-realignment\\" is a better way to put it than \\"ego-death.\\" Pride was still in play. One week, we hauled lumber by hand (by back, by arm) up the trail to build the new Penta-Privy.  We had a whole crew of volunteers going at it, back and forth, one-upping, slogging. It was it\'s own sort of luxury to focus on just one thing: moving wood. Move more, move faster, move better. Prime JH conditions. Maybe Osman can comment on this, but he might have come the closest out of us to folk-heroism that day. Here he is, crushed by some planks after he took a bad step, i.e. fell down dyin\':\\n\\n\\nDoes he look happy?\\n\\n\\n\u2013Matt\\n\\n\\n* \\"Elvis Presley Blues\\" was my top song of 2021. When I searched up GW\'s original to get the link, I saw that Jimmy Buffett also has an \\"Elvis Presley Blues.\\"\\nI thought it couldn\'t be a cover, but it is. Even Jimmy was a Welch fan. His take has a very different sound to it, which is great. I don\'t know how I didn\'t hear it earlier. You find new things all the time.\\n\\n\\n**This doesn\'t work as well in Houston.","artistWiki":"https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=1623135","albumWiki":"https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=6707072","relatedArtists":{"album":["Ketch Secor","Willie Watson","Critter Fuqua","Kevin Hayes","Morgan Jahnig","David Rawlings","Gillian Welch"],"other":["Morgan Jahnig","Ketch Secor","Willie Watson","Critter Fuqua","Kevin Hayes","David Rawlings","Gillian Welch"]}},{"number":98,"song":"Some New Town","artist":"Slobberbone","album":"Everything You Thought Was Right Was Wrong Today","spotifyLink":"https://open.spotify.com/track/49TVW9MntUpq9uT3f61IIa","textBody":"8-15-2024: Some New Town\\n\\n\\nFirst, an addendum.

We\'ve had all sorts of songs about moving on, hitting the road, rolling and rambling. Most of those have been sung by the ramblers. Today, we hear from someone left behind. \\"Some New Town\\" takes on the perspective of a man who stays put in his rainy, sleety town and wonders how it\'s going for his friend who took off.\\n\\n\\nListen past Brent Best\'s bluster, and you\'ll hear a tender song:\\n\\n\\nHope you live where everyone\'s happy, and I\\nHope you live where nothing gets crappy, and I\\nHope the sidewalks and your streets are clean, and I\\nHope you\'ve got good weather and everything\\n\\n\\nThat\'s not sarcastic. There\'s some hurt, sure, but the wishes are earnest. It\'s tough to see a friend go. It happens. I think the ideal way to hear this song would go like this: you\'re the friend. You\'re leaving. You take off early in the morning, make it a couple hours down the road (just too far to turn back), and find a CD in the glovebox. It\'s not yours. You pop it in the player. Unbeknownst to you, your friends the Slobs wrote the song, recorded it, and snuck it into your car so you\'d hear it on the road. \\n\\n\\nThat\'d be perfect. We don\'t get it that way, but it\'s still pretty good.\\n\\n\\nWhat\'s under the gruffness? In general, it\'s just how Slobberbone sounds. With this song in particular, I think they dial it up a couple notches (again, like the SNL cop video) to get through the hurt. The last lines are extra tough. They\'re when the guilt comes out \u2014 guilt, maybe, as proxy for understanding:\\n\\n\\nIf you, looked at me in some way I hadn\'t seen\\nIf you, took my words in some way I didn\'t mean\\nIf your, smile showed signs of some inner frown\\nOf thoughts of packing up and moving on to\\nSome new town\\n\\n\\nThen what? He lets it hang. There\'s not much to do. If wishes were fishes, we\'d be up to our ass in bass.

I didn\'t, so I can\'t. All I can say is that I feel him in the background.

If it weren\'t getting late, I might search JMRR for some corroborating quotes. Take it on faith.\\n\\n\\nEven if you remove the demons and spit and claws, Case writes some uneasy songs. More on that later. Reviewers describe her slice of the genre as \\"country-noir.\\" I\'d just say eerie. Look at the album art. Case grew up around Tacoma, and PNW references show up throughout her discography (e.g. Spanaway).\\n\\n\\nSince I\'m more of a Slobberbonian than a Miltonian these days, I\'ll go back to what\'s familiar. It\'s an easier connection to make: from Denton to Tacoma, we all miss someone.

Haters thought we wouldn\'t make it. I\'ve learned that I don\'t have as many ideas as I thought I might. When you don\'t write your ideas down, it feels like you have a bunch. Then, when you do write them down, it turns out you only have three or five. You can say three or five things a bunch of different ways, though, so I\'ll keep doing that.\\n_______________________________\\n\\n\\nSong #100: \\"Gone Tomorrow\\"\\nWho Made it: Lambchop\\nYear: 2012\\n_______________________________\\n\\n\\nThoughts: Back before I had Spotify (but after I switched off iTunes), I used to be a \\"Google Play Music\\" customer. I didn\'t pay for the streaming service. I still bought songs \xe0 la carte. This was probably fall of 2013, around the time I got my first smartphone. Sometimes, Google would give away songs. I got twenty for free in a sampler of artists from Merge Records. There was some standard indie stuff: Magnetic Fields, Spoon, Neutral Milk Hotel. There was also some less standard stuff, and my favorite: \\"Gone Tomorrow.\\"\\n\\n\\nWe all ought to admit to some level of niche pride. That\'s part of what got me into Lambchop. It felt special to like a song that other folks didn\'t know about. It was a weird little slice of secret wisdom. It was also one of the last digital songs that I \\"owned,\\" since I think I switched to Spotify not long thereafter. I remember listening to it on bus rides back from track meets. I\'ll call it my first earnest foray into \\"alt-country.\\" So, one hundred songs and eleven years later, I get back to where I started.\\n\\n\\nThis one veers experimental. It\'s an outlier, but not alone. A while back (F&L #26), I talked about \\"a metric space of songs\\" as a way to organize what I hear. A feature of that space is that some songs pack together in clusters. Some go by subject: I put \\"Martha\\" and \\"Operator\\" right by each other under the \\"sad folks singing to telephone operators about love gone by\\" label. Others are by sound: \\"Sunshine\\" (F&L #81) and \\"Amie\\" (F&L from the future) make a natural pair, and I hardly ever put one on a playlist without the other.  \\n\\n\\nSome clusters are harder to explain. Here\'s a three part, ordered cluster: \\"The Sexual Loneliness of Jesus Christ\\" followed by \\"Gone Tomorrow\\" followed by \\"All My Friends.\\" You can permute those cyclically, but listen to them back to back and try to hear what I mean. It\'s a trinity with one son, no father, two holy spirits. That makes it seem unbalanced, which makes me think I\'m missing part of the cluster. It ought to be a multiple of three, but shouldn\'t be six (see \\"John\\"). So, I\'m looking for nine \u2014 a trio of trios.\\n\\n\\nWhat holds them together? Not genre, not subject, but something about unknown emotion. Let me say this: some bland days overflow without warning. Maybe you can explain it in hindsight, maybe not. Way back at the beginning of the year, my old advisor came and gave a talk here at Rice. I hadn\'t seen him in a long time, but we\'d been emailing and zooming as we worked together on a paper. Midway through his talk, I got a little choked up \u2014 something about seeing an old, friendly face in a new place. I\'m grateful for how he\'s helped me over the past eight years, and I felt that while he talked. But that wasn\'t all and I don\'t know what the other part was. The choking-up related to the gratitude, but it wasn\'t from the gratitude. Something else was happening.\\n\\n\\nEven less scrutable: there\'s an unremarkable spot on campus that makes me feel the same way. It\'s not my favorite garden from F&L #95, but it is nearby. It\'s a field between some buildings. I can\'t say why or what, but I feel there unlike how I feel elsewhere. I don\'t mean that as a spiritual statement. I just mean to say that, sometimes, there are too many subtleties jumbled up in the background to put your finger on what tugs your heart. Still, something tugs. That\'s the way it is for me with this cluster of songs \u2014 less that they carry the same emotion, more that they provoke the same inside-out sense of emotion.\\n\\n\\n(The Field of Mystery, as seen this evening)\\n\\n\\nI think it\'s good to get verklempt. Those choke-ups and pockets of strange importance must be signs of fine living. Maybe it boils down to \\"awareness of quality\\" in the Pirsig sense. With that in mind, we\'ll tie this back to \\"Gone Tomorrow.\\" It\'s a very ZAMM-ish song. Take the koan near the end of the verbal half:\\n\\n\\nA bowl outside fills itself with rain.\\n\\n\\nThat \\"inside-out emotion\\" is what it must feel like to fill [yourself] with rain. It\'s not easy; it\'s not frequent. Pulling significance, even unnameable significance, from a barrage of subconscious noise is delicate. You need the shades wide open. This is one of the handful of ideas that comes back (F&Ls #14, 24, 27, 48, and 90 in particular): the need for clarity, the habit of blindness. \\n\\n\\nOnce I decide I want to, how can I fill myself with rain? I can\'t take any old field and command it to make me wistful. There\'s some tough balance at play in finding life attuned to quality. Run the engine clean: \'Spark up \u2014 gas down. Switch to Bat. Crank to compression, thumb down. Easy over \u2014choke out.\' EoE again. Gas and air and spark.\\n\\n\\nIt\'s harder with minds than with engines. We can\'t peek under the hood. Lambchop gets it:\\n\\n\\nThe fire almost starts itself\\nLooks like water comes from somewhere else\\nAnd I could use a thing or two, today\\n\\n\\nYou can\'t force a moment. No arrangement of routine and impulse, moderation and passion, yields the right richness. The balance bucks intention, too fickle for stasis. Momentum, though, might keep it upright \u2014 thus the roads and trains and bikes and horses. The motion doesn\'t need to be literal, but there must be some striving, some desire, something to turn the wheels.\\n\\n\\n\\"Gone Tomorrow\\" leaves its better part unspoken. All those instruments merge in and out, dreamlike, suspended. There\'s too much to take in at once. You have to pick a line. Listen to the drums, the piano, the strings. Listen to anything until it all collapses down: boom \u2014 boom  \u2014 boom. The luxury, here, is that you can go back, pick a new line, and listen again. Take advantage.\\n\\n\\n\u2013Matt","artistWiki":"https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=2294966","albumWiki":"https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=34854810","relatedArtists":{"album":[],"other":[]}},{"number":101,"song":"Desert Skies","artist":"The Marshall Tucker Band","album":"Carolina Dreams","spotifyLink":"https://open.spotify.com/track/10V3Oa2Nsq36g2NxARyVJy","textBody":"8-18-2024: Desert Skies\\n\\n\\nLet\'s call yesterday the end of Part 1.

I found what I needed in the corn fields racing across southern Wisconsin:\\n\\n\\n(I was thinking bout you crossing southern Wisconsin)\\n\\n\\nIt\u2019s interesting how when you have nothing but fields, road, and sky, a little detail can send your mind down a path long left behind. For me, it was sparkling brown eyes, ice skating, a dive bar dancefloor, and words left unspoken. In \u201cCanola Fields\u201d, the first strums drop us in the chartreuse sea, but the full band launches us back to a fleeting California summer and a girl the narrator couldn\u2019t quite hold onto. The listener relates. We\u2019ve all got something like this.\\n\\n\\nIn a greater sense, \u201cCanola Fields\u201d is about the ease at which people drift into and out of your life. If you aren\u2019t paying attention, it\u2019s so easy to let go and the boats drift apart in the chop and you never notice until they\u2019re too far apart. Jobs. Advanced degrees. Financial opportunity and familial ties. Choices and consequences. Kids and careers and a vague sense of order, busting apart at the seams.\\n\\n\\nSometimes, though, the waves push you together unexpectedly. Maybe it\u2019s a chance midnight encounter with an old friend on the streets of Manhattan, or meeting up in a Chicago rooftop club when your business travel plans align. Whatever it is, you\u2019ve got to tie up your boats and grab hold of the life rafts before they are all washed away. Make a phone call. Send a text, or better yet a letter. Write an alt-country newsletter, and reply-all sometimes.

Freeway - Live in New York, 1972\\"\\nWho Made it: Jerry Jeff Walker\\nYear: 1972\\n_______________________________\\n\\n\\nThoughts: For this one, we\u2019ve got two artists we\u2019ve seen before. Guy Clark wrote the song and Jerry Jeff was the first to record it. No bios needed  \u2014   Matt wrote more about these two in F&L 28 and 52, and their names are sprinkled throughout the archive.\\n\\n\\nGuy Clark wrote this song after waking up in a car\u2019s backseat at 4 a.m. and muttering the chorus: \u201cIf I could just get off this L.A. Freeway without getting killed or caught.\\" At the time, he was employed at a dobro factory trying to break into the music industry, working long nights and just trying to survive. He scribbled the line with his wife\u2019s eyebrow pencil on a fast food bag and revisited it after he left California. Jerry Jeff recorded it in \u201872.\\n\\n\\nMost of the time the background of how a song got written is dubious. It\u2019s made up, only vaguely related, or controversial to get the people talking.  But I trust Guy here. Guy\u2019s epiphany in the back of the car is exactly what L.A. freeway is about. Getting the fuck out. Waking up at 4 a.m. in a shitty situation in a town you dislike, feeling trapped, and saying I gotta leave. Sometimes you make it out, but sometimes you get \u201ckilled or caught.\\" There\u2019s no clear way out, and the land ain\u2019t bought yet, but you know it\u2019s out there, and it\u2019s not here.\\n\\n\\nI won\u2019t dive too deep into the verse lyrics (I wasn\u2019t an english minor and haven\u2019t written this much in 4 years) but the narrative goes: let\'s leave this town already > it wasn\u2019t all that bad > don\u2019t worry we\u2019re gonna be alright. I\u2019d encourage listening closely to the masterful lyrics. Moldy box of vanilla wafers. Love\u2019s a gift that\u2019s truly handmade. Leave the key in the old front door lock.\\n\\n\\nThis song is smooth. I chose this version mostly for the harmonica hook, but also because the arrangement is a bit thicker. On the Fussin\u2019 and Lovin\u2019 rock to country to folk spectrum, this is smack in the middle. And it\u2019s very Texas. The Texas Tunesmith (A former niche radio program based out of Austin) vouches, \u201cIf you really want to spread the Gospel of Texas Music and do so effectively, button your lip and just leave a copy of LA Freeway behind. Come back in six months. If they\u2019re not converted by then, shake the dust from your boots and move on, and do so quickly or you might find yourself talking to a pillar of salt.\u201d\\n\\n\\nPersonally, I already made it off the L.A. freeway without getting killed or caught, and made sure JJW was playing when I saw Anderson Overlook one last time. I\u2019d encourage you next time you leave a town for the final time, queue this one up and bask it in. You\u2019re probably headed to some land you ain\u2019t bought.\\n\\n\\n\u2013Sean","artistWiki":"https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=1050883","albumWiki":"https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=1050883","relatedArtists":{"album":[],"other":[]}},{"number":105,"song":"Let the Good Times Roll","artist":"Natural Child","album":"Hard In Heaven","spotifyLink":"https://open.spotify.com/track/3mTXHKXZ7cehg9BZnhCt6w","textBody":"8-22-2024: Let The Good Times Roll\\n\\n\\nNew GW drops tomorrow.

Too much shit, too many decisions. I think now\u2019s a perfect time for me to finally get my guest feature into Matt.\\n\\n\\nToday\u2019s F&L brings a familiar face into the playlist, and knowing Matt\u2019s appreciation for the guy, I\u2019m sure it won\u2019t be his last appearance. In my opinion, Townes Van Zandt is in the conversation on \u201cgreatest songwriter of all time,\u201d up there with the likes of Brian Wilson, Joni Mitchell, Hank Williams,\u2026Dylan. \\"Lungs\\" is no exception to his lyrical prowess. I told Matt before writing this up that writing about this piece is a little intimidating to say the least. I\u2019m not much of a poet, so I won\u2019t dig too deep. \\n\\n\\nFirst, for a little background\u2026\\n\\n\\nI was first introduced to TVZ last summer while driving with Matt up to Vedauwoo for a day-hike as we dicked around waiting for the other dudes to get into a town for what would be an epic road trip to the Bighorns. Turns out, I knew a lot of TVZ songs, made popular by artists like Willie Nelson and Emmylou Harris, but didn\u2019t know he was the man behind all of them. Now his albums are a fixture in my road trip rotation. I think I listened through Our Mother the Mountain six times on my drive up to Missoula, MT earlier this summer. \\n\\n\\nLast thing before we get into the song. I just want to express my appreciation for TVZ as a guitar player. I feel his skills with a six-string get overshadowed by his skills as a songwriter. Just take a listen to his Live at The Old Quarter album. It\u2019s a must-listen. Besides a knee-slapper of a joke, in it you\u2019ll find delicate fingerstyle in songs like \\"Rex\'s Blues\\" or \\"If I Needed You\\" and powerful, more percussive picking in \\"Lungs\\" or \\"White Freightliner Blues\\" (if you can stand a some off-beat clapping). It takes a lot to capture a crowd without the help of a band.\\n\\n\\nNow to \\"Lungs\\"\u2026\\n\\n\\nThe slick slide and hammer-ons in the studio version of \\"Lungs\\" immediately gets you hooked. If any of you in the audience dabble in a little guitar playing, I highly recommend taking a stab at this song. Most of the fretting can be done with just one finger; it\u2019s the right hand that\u2019s doin\u2019 all the work. \\n\\n\\nThe guitar intro leads into a thumping drum. It sounds a bit like what I imagine a doctor hears through their stethoscope while doing a physical on an anxious patient. Not steady, but erratic. Pairing the pounding drum with a shimmering tambourine and crying dobro gives the song a bluesy western flair. Like a lot of old country and folk songs, \\"Lungs\\" is about the struggle of gettin\' through life. However, Van Zandt adds an extra layer of desperation, vulnerability, and existentialism that takes it to another level. In a 1997 tribute, Lyle Lovett pulled an old quote from Townes saying \u201cthis song should be screamed, not sung.\u201d\\n\\n\\nWon\u2019t you lend your lungs to me\\nMine are collapsing\\n\\n\\nOof. Getting heavy right off the bat. Some theories suggest this first line is about the breathing problems that developed after going through insulin shock therapy to treat his manic depression (a now discredited treatment). Steve Earle said Townes wrote it while battling pneumonia, which frames the lyric more literally. \\n\\n\\nPlant my feet and bitterly breathe\\nUp the time that\'s passing\\nAnd breath I\'ll take and breath I\'ll give\\nAnd pray the day\'s not poison\\nStand among the ones that live\\nIn lonely indecision\\n\\n\\nThis first verse sets the tone for the rest of the song. It\u2019s about rolling with the punches \u2013 surviving.\\n\\n\\nFingers walk the darkness down\\nMind is on the midnight\\nGather up the gold you\'ve found\\nYou fool it\'s only moonlight\\nAnd if you try to take it home\\nYour hands will turn to butter\\nYou better leave this dream alone\\nTry to find another\\n\\n\\nVan Zandt\u2019s guitar and music help him cope with the darkness and depression he felt. The second half feels like he\u2019s trying to talk himself out of pursuing an unachievable dream. Maybe it\u2019s a reference to his pursuit of a music career, or a life without demons.\\nThe final two verses finish us off with some biblical imagery. They\u2019re a bit above my paygrade, so I\u2019ll leave some interpretation for y\u2019all. For now, back to packing.\\n\\n\\n\u2013Eli","artistWiki":"https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=292709","albumWiki":"https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=9313154","relatedArtists":{"album":["Townes Van Zandt"],"other":[]}},{"number":107,"song":"The Girl Who Danced Oklahoma","artist":"Terry Allen","album":"Lubbock (on everything)","spotifyLink":"https://open.spotify.com/track/2a8ujAXM9A8FGalM8OmDkA","textBody":"8-24-2024: The Girl Who Danced Oklahoma\\n\\n\\nQuick note before we get to the meat: Woodland, the new Welch/Rawlings album, is great.

I made this meme back in 2022 and sent it around.\\n\\n\\n TA_Meme.jpg \\n\\n\\nNo bites.*\\n\\n\\nHe\'s been touring the U.S. to promote his new biography.

That\'s less true with \\"Oklahoma.\\" It\'d be a strange one to hear on the radio, and doesn\'t make sense on shuffle. It\'s in the sweet-spot between weirdo-performance and standard good tuneage. Like most songs from L(oE), it\'s a character piece, a micro-story in the larger ensemble.\\n\\n\\nKeep a sense of time. The first half, on its own, isn\'t too special. It\'s good for its exposition, TA twang, and lines like \'livin close to the bone\' and \'honky-tonk mind.\' If that were all we had, though, I\'d skip it. It\'s one of Allen\'s strengths: testing your patience. Will \\"Oklahoma\\" liven up or waste your time?\\n\\n\\nAllen doubles down. I won\'t say when (because it\'s better to guess than to know), but you\'ll hear the interlude. It\'s a sonic page-break. It\'s a trick. Imagine that you\'re listening on a turntable with no progress bar to spoil things. You wonder for a while if it\'s supposed to do that, and you might decide it\'s not. You get up to check for scratches. Just before you lift the needle, it breaks \u2014 gotcha! The song comes back, ten years later, far from Oklahoma. Now you\'re right by the speakers. When the strings come in and lift the piano off your neck, the gambit pays off. The song transcends.\\n\\n\\nIt had to go that way. A resurrection needs three parts, and the first can\'t be too fun. Allen has schemes like this all over: try \\"The Radio ... and Real Life\\" off Juarez and listen for his switch-flip click.\\n\\n\\n\u2013Matt\\n\\n\\n*Back when I coached cross-country, I had to drive a transit van around to the meets. Most drives weren\'t too long, but we had to go farther afield for championships. I used my driver\'s privilege to pick the tunes.** I\'m sure most of the kids were either asleep or had headphones on, but I like to think that there was at least one TA convert among the bunch.\\n\\n\\n**Long precedent of using van drives to push musical agendas. Usually it\'s neutrally received, but I heard at least one second-hand complaint about excessive Springsteen on Club Nordic shuttles.","artistWiki":"https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=1718517","albumWiki":"https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=11534178","relatedArtists":{"album":["Terry Allen","Lloyd Maines","Kenny Maines","Curtis McBride","Allan Shinn","Richard Bowden","Ponty Bone","Don Caldwell","Joe Ely","Luis Martinez","Jesse Taylor","Tommie Anderson","Mark Anthony","Russ Standefer","Ruth Ann Truncale","Susan Allen","Karen Blalack","Leslie Blackburn","Monterey High School Marching Band"],"other":["Terry Allen"]}},{"number":108,"song":"The Old Black Hen","artist":"Songs: Ohia","album":"Magnolia Electric Co.","spotifyLink":"https://open.spotify.com/track/3gDYPETbbMdCb3PZkXmNWn","textBody":"8-25-2024: The Old Black Hen\\n\\n\\nPreviously, we heard Jason Molina with Magnolia Electric Co. on \\"Leave the City\\" (F&L #21).

It\'s not as deep a cut as others on this playlist, but there\'s a lot of history to dig into here.\\n\\n\\nThe journey of 500 Miles to get to me is a long one, appropriately. It starts anywhere from a hundred to a hundred and forty years ago, depending who you ask, and passes by everyone from Hedy West, the modern version\'s apparent author, to folk-jazzer Terry Callier, Peter Paul and Mary, Woody Guthrie, and Fiddlin\' John Carson. Give \'em a listen. The song\'s come a long way.\\n\\n\\nCarson, who sort of started country music, played the first recorded version way back in 1924, in between singing odes to trees used in lynchings and pogrom anthems. After a stint as a national megastar, the illiterate Fiddlin\' John died an elevator operator, a job he begged off of a segregationist senator.* Rags to racism to riches to rags again. American as apple pie, or owning slaves, or freeing slaves. It\'s an odd country.\\n\\n\\nRegardless of those All-American roots, it became a global hit. See the wikipedia for an incomplete list of foreign covers, the Pakistani club remix of the Bollywood version, or this playlist which has five covers from Chinese pop girlies alone.\\n\\n\\nThe reason I picked the Bobby Bare version is it\'s the best one. Lacking the stilted weirdness of the folk singers, eschewing the treacly hyper-sincerity of the Mumford-ass 2010s covers. Bobby\'s performance hits the emotion hard but lets you know this is all a story he\'s telling for sympathy. Plus, he prunes the lyrics to just the bare necessities.\\n\\n\\nAnd that opening, a perfected version of a motif from some of the older versions, oh that\'s the stuff they started writing music to get at, man. Nailed it Bobby. \\n\\n\\nTeardrops fell on Mama\'s note /\\nWhen I read the things she wrote / \\nShe said, we miss you son, we love you. Come on home.\\n\\n\\nBobby\'s version was the most commercially successful too, and was the reason, along with PP&M, that the song went global.\\n\\n\\nTellingly, in both those hit versions, West\'s Ella, Carson\'s wagon and woman, Guthrie\'s watch-and-chain-pawning, all the specific details are gone. Bobby even takes out the \'Lord\' out the chorus and trashes the train whistle, the recurrent motif from every other version, in favor of focusing on his memories of the hearth. A lesson: if you want your art to reach everyone and last, strip it down to the bareness.\\n\\n\\nBy some strange angel, a Pakistani boy far from home heard Bobby Bare\'s 500 Miles, lyrical chemical concentrate that it is, and felt it in his bones from the opening lines, just the same as a girl in a Greenwich Village bar in the 50s, a Japanese radio jockey in the 70s, an Appalachian farmer in the 30s. \\n\\n\\nA note, a soreness, a mama, being far away. A whole planet of people bobbling around trying to make it home. Write about that. You\'ll never go out of style and never get mistranslated.\\n\\n\\nSafe travels,\\nOsman\\n\\n\\n* Not before he recorded his version of the hit: It\'s a Shame to Whup Your Wife on a Saturday.","artistWiki":"https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=1068978","albumWiki":"https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=72093988","relatedArtists":{"album":[],"other":["Bobby Bare"]}},{"number":112,"song":"Salome","artist":"Old 97\'s","album":"Too Far To Care","spotifyLink":"https://open.spotify.com/track/2f9KVxhDj892tuGmRQ2Px0","textBody":"8-29-2024: Salome\\n\\n\\n_______________________________\\n\\n\\nSong #112: \\"Salome\\"\\nWho Made it: Old 97\'s\\nYear: 1997\\n_______________________________\\n\\n\\nThoughts: Naming songs after women is nothing new. Naming songs \\"Salome\\" isn\'t either. It\'s a name with biblical connections. That\'s not my forte, so I won\'t get into the details. I\'m not sure it matters much for the song. You can read what the English National Opera has to say about her. In short, she gets a bad rap.\\n\\n\\nWhat about The 97\'s Salome? Maybe the love gone bad is her fault. Maybe she will wreck another man. But, like her namesake, I\'d guess that she\'s just catching blame. Why? Here\'s the chorus, addressed to her:\\n\\n\\nAnd I\'m tired of makin\' friends, and I\'m tired of makin\' time\\nAnd I\'m sick to death of love, and I\'m sick to death of tryin\'\\nAnd it\'s easier for you, yeah it\'s easier for you\\nAnd it\'s easier for you, yeah it\'s easier for you\\n\\n\\nI\'m not above self-pity, but I\'ll still call it out. I can choke up and smell hogwash. It\'s like in \\"Some of Shelly\'s Blues\\" (F&L #15) when Nesmith says \'there\'s nothing so hard about the life that you\'ve lived\' \u2014 don\'t believe it. Something\'s always hard.\\n\\n\\nWe could put \\"Salome\\" in the \\"worn-out\\" subgenre (F&Ls #2, 9, 38, 46, 64, 74, others). What do you want when you\'re tired of makin\' friends, tired of makin\' time, sick to death of love, and sick to death of tryin\'? First, maybe a break. You want a freebie. You want to get that stuff without tryin\'.*\\n\\n\\nIf you don\'t, what then? Do like the singer: pretend that you\'re a martyr. It\'s back to \\"pleasuring yourself with sadness.\\" When you\'re down on your luck, there\'s some ugly joy in imagining that you\'re the most down on your luck.

Tired or peppy, the first line\'s true: another day has come and gone. Criss-crossed by forces, I\'ll see what gives.\\n\\n\\nThe point is vivacity. Get-up-and-go. The notion in my head. Remember what gets you going. This song makes me think of a night back in Summer \'21 when I\'d gone wanderin\'. I was back in NH for the summer, one year removed, working trails. The crew went to Hanover for the night and crashed a Rock party. I got it in my head to walk off, and made it to Enfield by morning.

This is a Saturday song if ever there was one. \\"LTG\\" came to me by way of Uncle Joe: back in \'06 or \'07, he made a Christmas CD and sent copies to family. Some songs were festive, and others were just good. This is one of my favorites.*\\n\\n\\nUncle Joe lived near Glenwood Springs back then, but now he\'s in Centennial. As it happens, Darrell Scott used to play semi-frequently at The Beartree (the best tavern in town).\\n\\n\\n BT_Sign.jpg \\n\\n\\nThe Beartree was great. I spent about half an hour just now trying to find a good picture or scan of its old menu, which had artwork explaining some of the local flavor. This was the best I turned up:\\n\\n\\n BT_Menu.png \\n\\n\\nThe original Beartree switched ownership back in 2019 and rebranded as Bear Bottom grill. This was (literal) front page news in Laramie:\\n\\n\\n BT_News.png \\n\\n\\nThe new place still has decent food, and keeps a full lineup of shows. But, I think it lost some soul.**\\n\\n\\n* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *\\n\\n\\nNow\'s a fine time to hear \\"LTG.\\" Bluegrass legend Tim O\'Brien (see F&L #65) backs up Scott and hits the licks. It\'s a rare \\"gone\\" song without a trace of glumness. It might be the happiest tune yet. I don\'t think it\'s a fakeout, either, like I  tried to claim with \\"Rolling Along\\" (F&L #7). It\'s honestly, through and through, full of wonder.***\\n\\n\\nHow does that work? Subject-wise, it\'s close to some real bummers (e.g. F&Ls #21, 50, 111). It would be easy to lean on nostalgia, to lament what ain\'t coming back again. But, crucially, it doesn\'t. Darrell\'s narrator is stoked to go to Nashville and live hard. Then, by the time the last chorus comes around, he\'s stoked to be back on the farm, settling down with ol\' Delia, just like she thought they would.\\n\\n\\nWhat happened to ain\'t coming back again? Is there a contradiction?\\n\\n\\nI say no. It\'s like the old adage: \\"No man ever steps in the same river twice, for it\'s not the same river and he\'s not the same man.\\" Our hero here smiles because he\'s learned to love the river  \u2014  any river  \u2014 for the sake of the splashing. He left then went back, but he didn\'t really leave and he didn\'t get back. He just felt the flow.\\n\\n\\nThere\'s wisdom in the water. By the end of the loop, he\'s earned good taste. He knows what\'s cookin\' and what\'s got no soul. Extra points for punning:\\n\\n\\nThey sound tired, but they don\'t sound Haggard\\nThey got money, but they don\'t have Cash!\\nThey got Junior, but they don\'t have Hank\\nI think, I think, I think, the rest is\\nA long time gone\\n\\n\\nThat verse does a better job than I\'ve managed of describing what I want on this list. It goes by gut, and guts need soul.\\n\\n\\n\u2013Matt\\n\\n\\n*The CD had an outsized influence on my taste. It was also my first encounter with John Prine. More on that later.\\n\\n\\n**I mostly stand by this, but played it up a little for the sake of metaphor.\\n\\n\\n***If this version of \\"LTG\\" doesn\'t make you smile, try out The Chicks\' cover.

I meant it when I said it. Today was supposed to be \\"Queen of the Silver Dollar,\\" but I couldn\'t get started \u2014 all I had to say was \\"it\'s fun and it sounds good.\\" Since \\"Dollar\\" was a Dr. Hook/Shel Silverstien original, I decided to trade one cover for another and switch to \\"My Father\'s House.\\" I\'m bending the rules, maybe, but it feels like the right call. It\'s my father\'s birthday, and he loves the Boss. That\'s reason enough.\\n\\n\\nOf course, you should hear the original. Join the cool kids who like Nebraska now,\\nand you can flex on your friends when it gets a boost from JAW. You should also listen to this Cowboy Junkies cover: it sounds like they recorded it during a soundcheck, and it\'s mostly just Margo Timmins. What a showcase. Even if her bandmates were used to hearing her every day, I can\'t imagine how anyone could work in that room (or laugh, or talk) instead of just listening. I\'d be floored.*\\n\\n\\nHarris is a fan of Springsteen, as he is of her. She\'s covered a bunch of his songs: \\"Mansion on the Hill\\", \\"Tougher than the Rest\\", \\"Racing in the Street\\", and \\"The Price You Pay\\" at least. I\'m sure she\'s done more live. Make sure to watch this video of her playing \\"RITS.\\" It commits a faux pas by putting an interview over the sax solo, but what she says in the clip is good enough that I\'m going to transcribe the whole thing (since I know some of you don\'t click the links):\\n\\n\\n\\"You know and I, I\'m a singer, so first I go for the song. And all I do is listen to the lyrics. And if you listen to the lyrics of the couple of Bruce Springsteen songs I\'ve done, especially \\"Racing in the Streets\\", they\'re, in their attitude and in their style, they\'re country, in the sense they\'re simple, they tell a story. Sometimes you have to look outside. Sometimes you get too close to something, you know. Maybe the country people who were supposed to be writing country are too locked into it and can\'t see the forest for the trees, so you go out to somebody who\'s a rock writer, and get something and just do it in your own style and you make it into a country song . . . or maybe it\'s just my refusal to accept the fact that, you know, I wanna do any song that I wanna sing. I\'ll find a way to do it.\\"\\n\\n\\nNailed it. This whole project is sort of niche, but hearing Emmylou Harris talk about the country soul of Springsteen in the middle of that song is perfect. Nothing is more up my alley.\\n\\n\\n\u2013Matt\\n\\n\\nPS:  \'Shining across this dark highway where our sins lie unatoned\' is such a hard line.\\n\\n\\n*I do like the part when she forgets the words and the crew helps out, though.

Front: Parsons, Hillman)\\n\\n\\nThe first published recording of \\"Wild Horses\\" was this version from Burrito Deluxe. Songwriting credits list Keith Richards and Mick Jagger. How\'d it wind up on a Burrito Brothers album? Parsons had been hanging out with the Stones around the time of the BD recordings. The story goes that Jagger showed Parsons \\"Horses\\" when the Stones weren\'t ready to record it, and offered to let FBB use it for their album. FBB did their version for BD in \'70, then the Stones put their (much more famous) version on Sticky Fingers in \'71 \u2014two great bands, two great takes.\\n\\n\\nSome folks don\'t buy that story. Some folks think that Parsons wrote \\"Wild Horses\\" and gave it to his friends Jagger & Richards. Will James over at No Depression wrote a fiery article, digging into the lyrics and explaining why \\"Horses\\" must have been a Parsons original. The chief piece of evidence is Parsons\' lyrics journal (now owned by the Hard Rock Cafe), with \\"Horses\\" written down, drafted, embellished and illustrated. It\'s enough to cast doubt on the \\"accepted\\" credits.\\n\\n\\nI don\'t have a dog in the fight. I like the Stones; I like Parsons. Both versions of \\"Horses\\" are close to perfect. Instead of picking a side (and plastering Facebook with angry comments), I\'ll take a spiritual stance: \\"Wild Horses\\" sprang, necessarily, from the milieu. The land was rich, so something grew.\\n\\n\\nWhy not? Think of Newton and Leibniz, or all the other cases of multiple discoveries. It\'s similar here. I don\'t mean that Parsons and Jagger happened to both write the same song on their own; I mean that they were both in the right scene at the right moment to make hearing/writing/playing a gem like \\"Horses\\" inevitable. When we\'re ready, the work comes out. Hillman and Sneaky and Clarke and Clark and Dillard and Crosby and McGuinn and all the others out there borrowing and trading and drinking and fighting put their blood in the pie. They all heard the music.\\n\\n\\nAs usual, TVZ gets it right: \\"Somebody Had to Write It.\\"\\n\\n\\n\u2013Matt\\n\\n\\n*Unexpected Zappa appearance on F&L. If you pick one song from the Sneaky-sampler to check out, make it this one. Huge respect to Frank for letting Pete go crazy on the solo.\\n\\n\\n**Gene Clark (no \\"e\\") is the Clark of D&C, not Michael Clarke.\\n\\n\\n***Leadon wrote The Eagles\' song \\"My Man\\" about Gram Parsons.

We\'ve heard Mike Cooley\'s rough-edged folk wisdom on songs before (F&Ls #5, 53, 76), but never quite this dense. No warm-up, no hedging \u2014 he gets right to the point:\\n\\n\\nWell, my daddy didn\'t pull out\\nBut he never apologized\\n\\n\\nCome on. It\'s crass, sure, but crass with purpose. There\'s a difference between \\"unapologetic\\" as in \\"not hiding\\" and \\"unapologetic\\" as in \\"looking to offend.\\" Contrast Mike\'s bluntness with other, crappier \\"country\\" songs that push buttons to cater to the \\"big ol\' truck\\" crowd. Here, in ten words, we get humor, swagger, a father figure, an origin story, and the first bit of boldness that ties the song together. Considering most \\"cyclic, multigenerational-sagas\\" I know run in the neighborhood of 600+ pages, the thrift here is outstanding.\\n\\n\\nThe next line\'s even better:\\n\\n\\nRock and roll means well,\\nBut it can\'t help tellin\' young boys lies\\n\\n\\nIf this were a rock project instead of country, I might have taken \\"Rock and Roll Means Well\\" as the title. I\'m glad to have been one of those lied-to young boys, and to now be a lied-to young man. I like the lies. I have favorites. Two decades before Decoration Day, Springsteen asked: \'Is a dream a lie if it don\'t come true?\' To tie my own answer onto today\'s song: yes, but that\'s a good thing. Lies give you something to chase when the dreams aren\'t ready.\\n\\n\\nOnward. What do we have for the ramblers?\\n\\n\\nAll my friends are restless, all they do is talk it down\\nTwo or eight lanes, it don\'t matter, it\'s just another town\\nThere\'s a fool on every corner, on every street, in every one\\nAnd I\'d rather be your fool nowhere than go somewhere and be no one\'s\\n\\n\\nAgain: come on. Here\'s my \\"driving to Houston\\" story: up until last year, I was not a big city driver.* I like Wyoming roads and the empty ones in New England. I would drive in Massachusetts when I had to, but I was rarely happy about it. So, when I got packed for my move, I had to psych myself up. I knew the worst part of my drive would be right at the end. The night before driving into Houston proper, I probably spent thirty minutes on Google maps, terrifying myself with the spaghetti bowl of highway interchanges I\'d hit in the morning.\\n\\n\\n HTX_Spaghetti.png \\n\\n\\nLook at that monster. Here\'s another picture, zoomed in, so you can count the lanes:\\n\\n\\n HTX_Sketti_Zoom.png \\n\\n\\nOnce I was in it, it wasn\'t as bad as expected \u2014 bad, but not as bad as expected. It felt like Rainbow Road, since the highway gets lifted way up so it can go over the other ones.

Second, the couple\'s previous band (previous home?) was called The Hilltops \u2014 maybe a subtle reference there.

I\'ll stop bringing it up when it stops making sense.\\n\\n\\nLast thing: why call it \\"Mountain Girl\\"? Maybe it\'s a nod to Mountain Girl, or maybe it\'s a crunchy crush. What\'s more interesting is how they put the title in the song. On the version I linked, there\'s no \\"mountain girl\\" in the lyrics. Listen to the song, though, and try to hear where it could fit.

My desk is clear, except for a Cuhrs Bankit and one totemic Marlboro (in homage to the album cover).*\\n\\n\\n TVZ_TVZ.png \\n\\n\\nMy intention is two-fold:\\n* First, to feel better. Thoughtful screen-time is still screen-time, and I\'d like not to fry my eyes. It\'s easier on paper, too \u2014 freedom in permanence.\\n* Second, to mimic a mindset. \\"FTSOTS\\" feels very interior, like it\'s lifted from a journal. It\'s the musical equivalent of a thoughtful walkabout. The \\"newsletter\\" already leans toward personal writing on public display (byproduct of infrequent replies), but I wanted to double down on that with this one.\\nI\'m looking at the (physical) album now. The name, his name, is tiny, way at the bottom, more like a label for a figure than a title. The font on the \\"French Bread\\" crate is much larger. His eyes are closed; his door is open.\\n\\n\\nTomorrow\'s a work day, so I need to be deliberate with what I tackle. This is another dense one. Embarrassment of riches, exercise in restraint, etc. I\'ll hold myself to three bits.\\n\\n\\n********************************\\n\\n\\nIf nothing else, I ought to say something about the title: \\"For the Sake of the Song\\" does not mean \\"For the Sake of this Song.\\" This song is reaction; this song is digestion. It is not a call to action; it is not an explanation. We hear the constant question: am I living right? The asking is positive evidence, but yields no conclusion.\\n\\n\\n********************************\\n\\n\\nSecond thing: frustration. The frustration I mean is the doubled frustration of not understanding and not being understood. There\'s some humor in starting a (fairly) sad song with \'why does she sing her sad songs to me?\'\\n\\n\\nThen, later,\\n\\n\\nOh, my sorrow is real \\nEven though I can\'t change my plans\\nIf she could see how I feel \\nThen I know that she\'d understand\\n\\n\\nWritten or not, there\'s a twin-song out there, something sung from the other side. Everyone must feel the same way.\\n\\n\\n********************************\\n\\n\\nThird thing: meanness. I think I\'m a decent lad, but not as kind of one as I could be.

Like many duets, I assumed it was romantic, with his vocal partner acting as a lover\'s proxy. There\'s nothing wrong, per se, with hearing it that way, but it\'s not right. My issue was that I didn\'t know who the partner was. Steve has duets with some big names (Iris DeMent, Emmylou Harris, Lucinda Williams), but I didn\'t recognize the singer on \\"Fall.\\" I didn\'t bother looking it up either \u2014 this was pre-newsletter.\\n\\n\\nJump to two months ago: Stacey Earle, Steve\'s sister, opened for him at his concert in Houston. She sounded familiar, but I didn\'t connect the dots. Later, she came back out to sing \\"When I Fall,\\" and I had a minor fit. It made sense! I should be careful calling any song autobiographical, but this one\'s pretty clear cut (and Stacey/Steve said as much in their intro). The whole timbre of it changes when you hear it as a \\"thank-you\\" to someone who\'s really been there through it all, especially considering how much \\"all\\" they\'ve been through.\\n\\n\\nBy the time they got to Stacey\'s verse, I heard a new song:\\n\\n\\nAll these years I\'ve watched you trip and stumble\\nThere were times that I feared that you were lost\\nBut every tear that I dried after you tumbled\\nComes to mind when I\'m considering the cost\\n\\n\\nShould go without saying that I was getting misty.\\n\\n\\nNow, I want to point out another matched pair. Two and a half months before Transcendental Blues debuted, one of my all-time folk favorites hit the shelves: that\'s Nickel Creek by Nickel Creek.* The first concert I remember catching was a Nickel Creek show at the A&S Auditorium (April, 2006). I went with my aunt, uncle, and cousins. Seventeen years later, I caught my second Nickel Creek concert at the State Theatre in Portland, ME with Kevin \u2014 good times, both, but I\'ll remember the latter for longer.**\\n\\n\\nThe best song on Nickel Creek, and maybe the best song by Nickel Creek, is \\"When You Come Back Down.\\" It\'s another track from the famous \\"Uncle Joe Christmas Mix,\\" and an honest contender for my all-time top-ten. It\'s one of only a few songs (also including \\"Born to Run\\") that I go out of my way not to hear except on special occasions \u2014 I don\'t want to risk \\"wearing them out\\" by listening too much. They should stay special. So, even though I\'m writing about \\"WYCBD,\\" I\'m not going to put it through the usual looped-wringer. I can go off memory.\\n\\n\\nLike \\"When I Fall,\\" I don\'t think \\"WYCBD\\" means its most as a romance. Take it as a love song in a much broader sense. Again, there\'s evidence to back this up. The original version of \\"WYCBD\\" came from Tim O\'Brien in 1996. Check the credits, and you\'ll see that he co-wrote it with Danny O\'Keefe \u2014 remember him from F&L #32? As O\'Keefe tells the story, they wrote the song (at least in part) as a tribute to Bill Monroe, a bluegrass/country legend, who died in \'96.\\n\\n\\nThe perspective in \\"WYCBD\\" hews close to Stacey\'s in \\"WIF.\\" Put the two choruses in conversation:\\n\\n\\nBut whenever I\'m feelin\' low\\nI won\'t have to cry alone I know\\n\'Cause you will answer when I call\\nIf I soar above the clouds and then\\nI come crashin\' back to earth again\\nYou will catch me when I fall \u2014 (\\"When I Fall\\")\\n\\n\\nWhen you\'re soarin\' through the air\\nI\'ll be your solid ground\\nTake every chance you dare\\nI\'ll still be there\\nWhen you come back down\\nWhen you come back down \u2014 (\\"When You Come Back Down\\")\\n\\n\\nCould you find a more natural pair? Neither song denies the chance of crashing; both, in fact, assume it. Nor do they claim that falling won\'t hurt: there will be fire; there will be tears. Steve and Stacey and Tim and Danny don\'t peddle bad hope or cheap ignorance. They see a subtler, more substantial balm: the rich love we find in low times.\\n\\n\\nI\'ll keep lookin\' up\\nAwaitin\' your return\\nMy greatest fear will be\\nThat you will crash and burn\\nAnd I won\'t feel your fire\\n\\n\\nThe last line is crucial. It\'s the core of compassion. We need to know that we\'re on a team, that someone has our back. There\'s no safety net, but there\'s firm ground between flights. Sit, rest, cry, burn. See who helps you up.\\n\\n\\n\u2013Matt\\n\\n\\n*Back in summer \'16, post high-school/pre college, Will, Rhylan, Eli, and I did a road trip together through Wyoming and Utah \u2014 overall, maybe the best week ever. Nickel Creek got a lot of play time while we drove between campsites, so I\'ve got good memories tied to the album. We sang along (obviously) and got pretty good at \\"The Lighthouse\'s Tale.\\"\\n\\n\\n**Kevin and I bought tickets for the concert way in advance. It ended up happening during my school\'s \\"family weekend\\" when all the parents came to visit. I thought I\'d have to flake because I\'d be dancing in our performing arts show until just before the concert started. Keep in mind, Kevin drove over from NH. I made the right call and hopped in the RAV immediately post dance, booked it down I-295, and made it just in time to catch Thile and the Watkins kids \u2014 thank God for long openers.","artistWiki":"https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=194910","albumWiki":"https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=2855277","relatedArtists":{"album":["David Angell","James Blennerhassett","Noel Bridgeman","David Davidson","John Catchings","Dennis Crouch","Casey Driessen","Patrick Earle","Dan Gillis","Liz Kane","Yvonne Kane","Ray Kennedy","Doug Lancio","Kelley Looney","Dan Metz","Jim Murray","Will Rigby","Tim O\'Brien","Joyce Redmond","Darrell Scott","Mary Shannon","Sharon Shannon","David Steele","Benmont Tench","Ron Vance","Kristin Wilkinson","Bill Wright","Steve Earle","Tony Fitzpatrick"],"other":["Steve Earle"]}},{"number":136,"song":"Demonic Possesion","artist":"Drive-By Truckers","album":"Gangstabilly","spotifyLink":"https://open.spotify.com/track/05ipGRNJwCJYN7097ITPMK","textBody":"9-22-2024: Demonic Possesion\\n_______________________________\\n\\n\\nSong #136: \\"Demonic Possesion\\"\\nWho Made it: Drive-By Truckers\\nYear: 1998\\n_______________________________\\n\\n\\nThoughts: Have some fun.

Turn up the volume a bit for the \'kick-ass\' verse \u2014 you can hear the devil in the background, low and throaty. By the 3:09 mark, Hood\'s in overdrive.\\n\\n\\nI said way back in F&L #1 that \\" I\'m a sucker for calling out a solo\\". That\'s still true, especially for a self-call (e.g. Hood shouting \'my turn!\' then getting after it).* Off the top, I couldn\'t name a song with heavier guitar riffage and a mandolin solo.\\nAdd a \'butthole\' filter, and \\"Possession\\" stands alone.\\n\\n\\n\u2013Matt\\n\\n\\n*My favorite self-called solo is in Springsteen\'s \\"Give The Girl A Kiss\\" at the 1:42 mark. Being called \\"The Boss\\" is cool. Calling yourself \\"The Boss\\" is cooler.

I take this one literally: It\'s about a guy who wants his dog back. In the song, it sounds like a girl took the dog. That\'s never happened to me. I have lost dogs, though. \\n\\n\\nThe 2020 \u2013 2022 years were bad for family pets. Folks my age, who got childhood dogs around the same time, lost a few.

The original is When In Rome\'s from \'88. You may know it from the last scene in Napoleon Dynamite. Since I, like any cultured man, can quote* most of ND on command, I should have made the connection sooner.\\n\\n\\nHere are the circumstances: I got into Sturgill during a gap between viewings. I latched onto \\"The Promise,\\" probably due to subconscious recognition and positive associations. I had it in rotation for a year or two until the next time I queued up Dynamite. When the tetherball started swinging and that Wii Sports piano riff hit, the mental files merged \u2014a new link in the grand-Napoleanic web.**\\n\\n\\nSturgill\'s take tenderizes and de-shimmies the source material. It\'s big, swoony, and moody. It sounds like an unsent letter, like something you\'d write when you need some relief:\\n\\n\\nIf you need a friend, don\'t look to a stranger\\nYou know in the end, I\'ll always be there\\nBut when you\'re in doubt and when you\'re in danger\\nTake a look all around and I\'ll be there\\n\\n\\nThose are heavy words to hide. When words like that bounce around your head for long enough, they\'re bound to find a crack. That\'s the sense I get from Simpson\'s arrangement. The strings are barely there at 0:36, but you feel the pressure growing. They creep up, bit by bit, then twist the mood at 1:53. With \\"strings\\" as proxy for \\"words,\\" their escape fits the lyrics:\\n\\n\\nSometimes if I shout\\nIt\'s not what\'s intended\\nThese words just come out\\nWith no gripe to bear\\n\\n\\nIt\'s a good model for how things accumulate. The slow build isn\'t continuous. There\'s baseline growth and threshold moments. You can feel when the ratchet clicks, when you\'ve gone past the point of fading. The music video nails it.\\n\\n\\nThe last chorus brings it home in grand Simpson fashion. Rome missed their chance to shout, but Sturg gets it done. We hear him loud and clear.\\n\\n\\n\u2013Matt\\n\\n\\n*A great tweet once said: \\"before memes, guys used to sit around in a circle and quote Anchorman at each other for literal years.\\" I\'d replace Anchorman with Napoleon Dynamite, but the sentiment\'s the same. This was how my \\"advanced reading group\\" in the sixth grade passed our time out in the hallway when we were supposed to discuss Chasing Vermeer. Shout-out to Austin W. for great delivery on \\"do the chickens have large talons?\\"\\n\\n\\nSince time is a flat circle, I got into another quote-off this summer, out camping with the fellas and some new friends from Rhylan\'s college days. Old traditions fade, but tend to stick around.\\n\\n\\n**Someday, I\'ll write a deep-dive essay on Napoleon\'s watch: the Casio F91-W.*** What a classic. Keep an eye open, and you\'ll see it all over (which makes sense, since Wikipedia says it\'s the most sold watch in the world). It does everything you need and nothing you don\'t (no compass, no cell-phone, no pocket-knife, no megaphone). When I coached cross-country, I dipped into the athletics budget to buy one for everyone on the team (and saved a couple extras for myself). It\'s particularly popular among math folks I\'ve met: I\'m not sure why, but I suspect a confounding variable.\\n\\n\\n***Uncle Rico has the fancier silver version.

Unfortunately, the onset of autumn necessitates that I fall back into my FnL induced alt-country stupor. After binging the last dozen or so weeks of Mr. Radosevich\u2019s music and musings, I think I\u2019m ready to analyze the playlist\u2019s newest Luke Bell contribution, \u201cLoretta.\u201d\\n\\n\\nI plan to christen my future children with names that will result in the highest likelihood of them being serenaded by their highschool sweetheart from the lawn below their bedroom window in the days following their first big fight at the homecoming dance. I\u2019m talking Jude, Delilah, Caroline, etc. Loretta might make the short list. Put plainly, Loretta is a name made for good music. It\u2019s lyrical. It\u2019s whimsical. It rhymes with some cool words (vendetta \u2013 for any aspiring songwriters this seems like a slam dunk). If you don\u2019t believe me, refer back to Fussin\u2019 and Lovin\u2019 #17 and recall that we\u2019ve already met a Loretta this year courtesy of Townes Van Zandt.

They were all in The Highwaymen together (along with Willie).\\n\\n\\nTake a while with this verse:\\n\\n\\nMy thirsty wanted whisky, my hungry needed beans\\nBut it\'d been of month of paydays since I\'d heard that eagle scream\\nSo with a stomach full of empty and a pocket full of dreams\\nI left my pride and stepped inside a bar\\n\\n\\nI can\'t speak for how others see me, but I\'d say that \'hungry needed beans/pocketful of dreams\' is about as close as a rhyme could get to how I try to be. The \'eagle\' here probably means a drink, but I couldn\'t say which. Thunderbird? Yeungling? Barton\'s? He says he wants whiskey but gets a beer. It\'s hard to pin down.\\n\\n\\nBar patrons spouting dubious wisdom is a country staple: see \\"Faster Horses\\" and \\"People are Crazy.\\" As for fables, I\'d say \\"Devil\\" probably helped to inspire Guy Clark\u2019s \\"The Guitar,\\" and maybe \\"Gimme a Ride to Heaven Boy\\" (F&L # 20). This is the best of the bunch. It has the most needed message (chorus two, not chorus one) and the biggest flex:\\n\\n\\nI ain\'t sayin\' I beat the devil,\\nBut I drank his beer for nothing\\nThen I stole his song\\n\\n\\nWham. I hate the circumstance, but I\'m glad I got to spend some time with this song today. It dignifies faith.\\n\\n\\nI\'ll let Kristofferson handle his own sign-off. Thanks for the tunes.\\n\\n\\nI was born a lonely singer and I\'m bound to die the same\\nBut I\'ve gotta feed the hunger in my soul\\nAnd if I never have a nickel, I won\'t ever die ashamed\\n\'Cause I don\'t believe that no one wants to know\\n\\n\\n**************\\n\\n\\n\u2013Matt\\n\\n\\n*I can\'t think of another example to back this up, but it\'s true anyway.

I&S (the band) started as a folk duo, then Ian and Sylvia (the people) founded GSB as a country-rock outfit. The original version of \\"LLTTGO\\" was on GSB\'s debut album. The version I linked in the header, credited to Ian & Sylvia, is on a 2006 compilation. It sounds like they took the original and did some heavy remastering. I\'m used to the remaster, so that\'s what I\'ll put on the playlist.\\n\\n\\nAnyway, it\'s got its own sound. Dampered cowbell? Kick drum filled with pillows? The bass gets to lead in the first verse then falls in with a whole pack of strings for the second. Ian has great delivery, warping choice words (Toront-ah, dowwwwn, hiiighuhwayy). For a different take, hear what Tyler Childers and his mustache did with it.\\n\\n\\nSummer\'s gone in most parts of the country, but not too far gone.

Take a moment to listen back to \\"Player\\" (F&L #12). How was Mark doing back in May? Somber, maybe, but faithful. He was putting in time, waiting for the wheel to turn again. \\n\\n\\nKudos to Mark \u2014 gotta do your time. He was rippin\' that pedal steel hard. He was playin\' those cards. Work like that\'s gotta come back around.\\n\\n\\nHow\'s he doing today? How\'s \\"One Way Train\\"? \\n\\n\\nPretty hot. Mark\'s on top. High on the hog, if you will. That ol\' pedal\'s still rippin\' \u2014solo at 1:01 is crazy \u2014 and Mark sounds like he\'s landed on a good one. Consider:\\n\\n\\nWhen I see your smile\\nAll the miles make no difference to me\\nI\'ve been so many places\\nI\'ve seen too many towns\\nAlong the highway\\nBut your arms are where I plan to stay\\nCan\'t you see\\nIt\'s all a memory\\n\\n\\nAll a memory, is it? Maybe so. The best things now remind us of the best things then. But \u2014 crucially \u2014 memories stack. There\'s a compounding factor \xe0 la Pe^rt. So, when you get back to the circumstance, back to the \\"Old Time Feeling\\" (to bend a phrase), it all doubles up: the old, the new, familiar, strange. Cycles surprise us. No matter how many times we go \'round the loop, it\'s a miracle to make a turn and find the same scene.\\n\\n\\nThat\'s the real juice of it all. The fateful return. It makes you tall and proud and ready to run fast. The right twist cuts your day down from a list of lists to one fine point. It\'s a treat to focus, to get outside yourself while the getting\'s good.\\n\\n\\nCheers to Mark, wherever he may be.*\\n\\n\\n\u2013Matt\\n\\n\\n*I can\'t find shit about MJ online. Kevin pointed out that this song showed up on his Spotify page a few weeks ago. You can choose your adventure: either believe it\'s a listing error, or believe that MJ\'s been living his best, jazzy life in Spain for the past 45 years. If someone knows Spanish, please translate.

Love a song with a story in it and around it.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\u2013Matt\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nGuest Feature from Kevin\\r\\n_______________________________\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSong #149:  \\"Wichita\\"\\r\\nWho Made it: Gillian Welch\\r\\nYear: 2016 (and 2001, and 1993)\\r\\n_______________________________\\r\\n\\n\\nThoughts: This was one of many songs in the early days of GW+DR that ended up on the cutting room floor in the mid-90s\u2014makes you jealous of their cutting room\'s floor. It was actually handed over to bluegrass pair Tim and Mollie O\'Brien*, who had a hit with it in \'94, as Gillian mentions in the first official release of W+R singing it on some extra live material released as The Revelator Collection (including a few studio B&W films, which can be found on the filmographer\'s YouTube channel in glorious 360p). She also handed over \\"Orphan Girl\\" to the duo, a track also recorded the next year by F&L fav Emmylou Harris, and then eventually by Welch as the first track on their first record. \\"Wichita\\" would then come to us in studio form with a collection of \\"official bootlegs\\" released in 2016, which is the version before you today.\\n\\n\\nI find the song narratologically quite interesting: there\'s the narrator in the verses, a somewhat nosy, somewhat kind neighbor at the gas pump, and we as listeners are almost the narrator\'s gossipy interlocutor, eager to get the lowdown on that square peg of a girl who never fit in this round hole of a town. The song starts off as if we had just asked \\"what happened to her?\\", to receive the answer:\\n\\n\\nShe went back to Wichita\\nShe went back to her ma and pa\\nReckon I saw her next to my truck\\nPumping gas with the car packed up\\n\\n\\nWe get little hints of their gas conversation:\\n\\n\\nShe says for all my time, well, I ain\'t got much to show\\nYou can tell that man of mine and anyone who wants to know\\n\\n\\nBut then for the chorus, we cut to, in the movie of this song, our indirect main character driving westeastnorthsouthward with the windows down and the wind whippin\' and her mind full of our chorus:\\n\\n\\nGoin\' back where the grass grows tall\\nAnd the fields burn in the fall\\nShe can still hear the night birds** call\\nBack in __________\\n\\n\\nInsert yourself here. For our musical protagonist, it\'s Wichita; for Gillian (who wrote this tune a year after moving to Nashville with Rawlings) it might be Santa Barbara, and for me, who spent last week on Long Island for work dreaming about fields burning in this fall, it\'s up north in New England. Wind whippin\' I drove around NH this week, living in the unsung epilogue of our Welchian protagonist.\\n\\n\\nGood times have all been spent/She ain\'t broken but she\'s badly bent\u2014sometimes we need to gas up the car, say \\"aw heck,\\" and get back to Wichita.\\n\\n\\n\u2013Kevin\\n\\n\\n*Plenty of other smaller acts also covered it in the meantime and postime.\\n\\n\\n**One of two Gillian lyrical \\"night bird\\" mentions, the next one being 18 years later.","artistWiki":"https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=897049","albumWiki":"https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=897049","relatedArtists":{"album":[],"other":["Gillian Welch"]}},{"number":150,"song":"Indianapolis","artist":"\\"The Bottle Rockets\\"","album":"24 Hours a Day","spotifyLink":"https://open.spotify.com/track/4dCFpIPmSWi2fDQvcdp9dK","textBody":"10-6-2024: Indianapolis\\n_______________________________\\nSong #150: \\"Indianapolis\\"\\nWho Made it: \\"The Bottle Rockets\\"\\nYear: 1997\\n_______________________________\\nThoughts: Punting due to travel issues.

I might catch flack for this, but I don\'t think it earned that slot with its musicality. It sounds a little flat \u2014 the mandolin/slide guitar solos don\'t hit the same frenzy we\'ve heard from DBT (F&L #136) or MJ (F&L #12). Not bad, but unobtrusive.\\nWhy all the plays, then? There\'s plenty of competition in REK\'s catalog, so \\"FGA\\"* must have an edge. The edge, probably, is just what REK says: it feels good to feel good. Good enough, even, that it feels good to hear about somebody else feeling good, and so on down the line. We can get pretty far on low-down tracks from J. Molina and G. Clark, but fussers need to breathe. \\"FGA\\" cracks the window.\\nREK makes good choices with his mundane joys: winds between seasons, unexpected money, smiles you\'ve hoped to see. They\'d be harder to write a song about, but I\'d like to hear someone tackle the subtler joys of unknown cause \u2014 feelin\' good out of the (apparent) blue.\\nAs a thought experiment, insert yourself as the you in the last bridge/verse:\\nAnd I wanted you to see \'em all, I wished that you were there\\nI looked across the room and saw you standing on the stair\\nAnd when I caught your eye, I saw you break into a grin\\nIt feels so good, feelin\' good again\\nI like to think that REK wrote this as a kindly friend, hoping to cheer up his pals.

I pounded a couple seltzers (NA), walked to Black Hole, and had a coffee while I brainstormed today\'s letter and watched Van Zandt clips on YouTube. Next stop was HEB for a twelver of Victoria, back to my apartment to deposit the goods, then on to the record shop to see what was new. I snagged two winners:\\n\\n\\n KK_STD_MJ_MF.jpg \\n\\n\\nThe Garmin says that comes out to 16.3 miles of hoofin\'. Now (4:20 my time), I\'m resting the dogs and working the brain. On the back of Kristofferson\'s Silver Tongued Devil, there\'s a great quote to describe his work:\\n\\n\\n KK_Quote.jpg \\n\\n\\nOn the topic of back covers: take a look at The Late Great Townes Van Zandt\'s.\\n\\n\\n LGTVZ_Bird.jpg \\n\\n\\nPretty good. TVZ tells a fine story in Be Here to Love Me* about his mom and aunt reacting to his crass gesture. I looked, but no LGTVZ at Cactus today.\\n_______________________________\\n\\n\\nSong #157: \\"If I Needed You\\"\\nWho Made it: Townes Van Zandt\\nYear: 1972\\n_______________________________\\n\\n\\nThoughts: This is one of Van Zandt\'s more popular, more enduring, more successful songs. As he says BHTLM: \\"This song\'s been mighty good to me.\\" He describes writing it in a fever dream when he was living with Guy and Susanna Clark. He says some fascinating things about dreams: firing guns that don\'t fire, drinking drinks that don\'t burn. This is his story of the morning after:\\n\\n\\nI woke up the next morning and we all met in Guy\'s kitchen every morning for coffee. And, uh, it was real funny, real, you know, little kitchen table in a little room, a kitchen nook, right, with about four or five guitars, a banjo, leaning around it. And first I\'d cough, you know, *caw caw*, all the guitars would ring, and they call it, I think they call it \\"sympathetic harmonization.\\" Right, then Guy would cough and all the guitars would ring, Suzanne would cough and all the guitars would ring . . . And I said, \\"Look y\'all\\" \u2014 got the piece of paper \u2014\\"lemme play this,\\" and played it straight through the very first time, and it\'s, uh, never been changed . . . I mean I played it exactly correct, first time, from the dream.\\n\\n\\nThat\'s a golden moment. \\"Sympathetic Harmonization\\" could have made a good alternative title for the newsletter. It\'s eerie watching his interviews, hearing him answer questions like he\'s writing a song. Sometimes it\'s stilted, awkward, like the interviewers don\'t know what to make of him, or like he can\'t land his points without his guitar. It\'s hard to tell if he minds.\\n\\n\\n********************\\n\\n\\nEmmylou Harris and Don Williams had a hit with their cover of \\"If I Needed You\\". I love it, but I have some complaints. First, Don doesn\'t bring much to the table \u2014 he just reminds me of a watered down Waylon Jennings. Second, I\'m not sure it should be a duet \u2014 it muddles the perspective.** Third, and most grievous, they change the best line:\\n\\n\\nTVZ: Loop and Lil agree, she\'s a sight to see, a treasure for the poor to find.\\nEH/DW: Who could ill agree, she\'s a sight to see, a treasure for the poor to find.\\n\\n\\nNot mentioning the awkward construction of \'who could ill agree,\' it\'s a crime to forget the birds. As Guy Clark explains in this intro to a live performance of \\"IINY,\\" Loop and Lil were Townes\'s pet parakeets \u2014aka \\"Road Keets,\\" so named because he took them traveling.***\\n\\n\\nHere\'s what I picture with the first line: Van Zandt, a roadworn Cinderella, telling the birds about his great love. It reminds me of times when I\'ve been smitten and looking to tell anyone who\'ll listen about the girl. If the birds concur, even better. \'Ill agree\' paints no picture.^\\n\\n\\n********************\\n\\n\\nThis letter\'s getting long, and I\'ve just danced around the song. I\'ll say something short about verse two:\\n\\n\\nWell in the night forlorn, oh the morning\'s born\\nAnd the morning shines with the lights of love\\nAnd you will miss sunrise if you close your eyes\\nAnd that would break my heart in two\\n\\n\\nThink about the first couple lines in the context of TVZ\'s dream story. It reminds me of \\"Through the Morning, Through the Night\\" (F&L #44) \u2014 the feeling of having a dream color your day \u2014 and \\"Hands on the Wheel\\" (F&L #59) \u2014 the three sorts of mornings. Nothing beats waking up, remembering your luck, and rolling out to see what\'s next. I had a great morning earlier this week that felt just like that. I was walking to campus (listening to Wrecking Ball, Wrecking Ball, Wrecking Ball, and Wrecking Ball) with ten pounds of swagger \u2014 i.e. shin(ing) with the lights.\\n\\n\\nWith a truly great morning, or anything of that caliber, you want to share. Van Zandt nails the feeling in the last lines above. When you\'re on top you\'ve got to show folks how good good gets \u2014 especially if someone put you there. Failure to share is heartbreak. When good songwriters talk about having no choice but to write, I think that urge is part of what\'s driving them. They see something lovely, or terrible, or nobly normal, and they need to get it out. If not, they\'re flat.\\n\\n\\nIt\'s a hopeful impulse.\\n\\n\\n\u2013Matt\\n\\n\\n*Documentary. Plenty of great bits. It\'s on YouTube for now, appropriately hosted by a channel named \\"Blaze Foley.\\"\\n\\n\\n**I\'m not just picking on Williams. There\'s a version where Van Zandt and Harris duet, recorded in the \'90s. When I found it, I was disappointed \u2014 it doesn\'t scratch the itch. Too glossy. This is not a song that needs ooooo in the background.\\n\\n\\n***Clark explains that Townes would keep them in his jacket pockets, which seems familiar.\\n\\n\\n^In the Doc Watson cover that Van Zandt shouts out in his own live version, the line is \'surely you will agree\' \u2014 equally unevocative, but grammatically preferable.","artistWiki":"https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=292709","albumWiki":"https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=9278229","relatedArtists":{"album":[],"other":[]}},{"number":158,"song":"Perfect Timing","artist":"Drive-By Truckers","album":"Brighter Than Creation\'s Dark","spotifyLink":"https://open.spotify.com/track/0kZcO6YESNfGjM1Sgh84ef","textBody":"10-14-2024: \u201cPerfect Timing\u201d\\n_______________________________\\n\\n\\nSong #158: \\"Perfect Timing\\"\\nWho Made it: Drive-By Truckers\\nYear: 2008\\n_______________________________\\n\\n\\nThoughts: Song number seven from the Truckers.

Don\'t skip the auxiliara.\\n\\n\\n\u2013Matt\\n________________________________________________________\\n\\n\\nGuest Feature from Osman\\n_______________________________\\n\\n\\nSong #160: \\"Our Town\\"\\nWho Made it: Iris DeMent\\nYear: 1992\\n_______________________________\\n\\n\\nThoughts: This is a long one, set it aside for a darkling fall e\'ening when all feels for naught.\\n\\n\\nMost bad feelings in humans result from the inability to grasp that many scientific processes go only in one direction. Ancestral homes tip into floodwaters and dreams fall through cracks; toys break and organs fail. Reversal is hard, and generally not worth the taxpayer dollars.\\n\\n\\n\\"Our Town\\" (not to be confused with the James Taylor song written for PIXAR\'s Cars) grasps that some processes not only go in just one direction but also that said direction is straight down. Iris DeMent wrote the song, her first ever, at the age of 25, unbelievably young for the voice and feel of the tune.\\n\\n\\nSays DeMent, she drove by a \\"typical dead town there in the Midwest, a lot of boarded-up windows, little white buildings with peeling paint, all the life had gone right on out of it.\\" The song she wrote then, in 1993, made it unchanged to the cut on Spotify.\\nIris might be separated by Kdawg-approved sadboy poet A.E. Housman by a century, but boy can her voice summon the air that kills:\\n\\n\\nInto my heart an air that kills  \\n  From yon far country blows:  \\nWhat are those blue remembered hills,  \\n  What spires, what farms are those?  \\n\\n\\nThat is the land of lost content,\\n  I see it shining plain,  \\nThe happy highways where I went  \\n  And cannot come again.\\n\\n\\n\\"Our Town\\" slips you that heavy Housmanian message in DeMent\'s voice by coating it in a sweet sound. Ice cream with the veggies: guitar of the horizontal and vertical variety, some light lilting strings that really lock in towards the end. \\n\\n\\nThe narrator surveys her dissolving town: the car that never went far, the bar she got sore sitting forty years at, family tragedies, and all the good stuff that ever happened to her too. She loves it terribly. DeMent\'s voice is perfect here. Covers by prettier voices fail entirely to transmit the burden of the song.\\n\\n\\nAnd you know the sun\'s settin\' fast,\\nAnd just like they say, nothing good ever lasts.\\nWell, go on now and kiss it goodbye,\\nBut hold on to your lover,\\n\'Cause your heart\'s bound to die.\\nGo on now and say goodbye to our town, to our town.\\nCan\'t you see the sun\'s settin\' down on our town, on our town.\\n\\n\\nIn the final act, all the kicking the can down the road hits a dead-end. The town felt like it was going so long you kind of thought it\'d die later, on someone else\'s watch, but now it\'s really gone, and it\'s happening to you. Pay attention to the differences in bold:\\n\\n\\nBut I can see the sun\'s settin\' fast,\\nAnd just like they say, nothing good ever lasts.\\nWell, go on, I gotta kiss you goodbye,\\nBut I\'ll hold to my lover,\\n\'Cause my heart\'s \'bout to die.\\nGo on now and say goodbye to my town, to my town.\\nI can see the sun has gone down on my town, on my town,\\n\\n\\nDeMent never shies away from the big question with the rheumy eyes and gnarled hands, the final question. Let The Mystery Be, her opening track on the album contrasts well with Hadrian\'s deathbed missive to his soul, circa. 138 AD, see them both below. These verses are concerned with your soul, not your town\'s, but they both stare that one way street dead-on.\\n\\n\\nSome say once you\'re gone you\'re gone forever\\nAnd some say you\'re gonna come back\\nSome say you rest in the arms of the Savior if in sinful ways you lack\\nSome say that they\'re coming back in a garden\\nBunch of carrots and little sweet peas - (Osman Note: God, that\'s a great couplet)\\n....\\nI believe in love and I live my life accordingly\\nBut I choose, to let the mystery be\\n\\n\\n.\\n.\\n.\\nLittle soul, little wanderer, little charmer, \\nbody\u2019s guest and companion, \\nto what places will you set out for now? \\nTo darkling, cold and gloomy ones\u2014 and you won\u2019t make your usual jokes.\\n\\n\\nI wrote all the above at work after 4 o\'clock Tuesday. By 6, I\'d bummed myself out so terrifically I walked home in a daze. Then I clowned around with some friends, did right by family, helped out a dear pal, and heard from a person or two who, in my analysis, are some of the most compelling reasons for why God keeps the planet in spin. By 12 o\'clock I felt ten feet tall again, and began writing the rest.\\n\\n\\nA professor in school told me once that the wretched freaks in the Russian stories I like weren\'t just protagonists, they were challenges. She said their existence asked, now what? I\'m going nowhere, and you might become me or meet me. How will you live now !?\\n\\n\\nThe sun set on that Midwest town. As it will upon you, NAFTA or no NAFTA. What\'re you gonna do about it? Before it sets on your little wandering soul, what will you do? Find your bar, your misty morning, your lover who\'ll get to see your heart die, your car that doesn\'t go. Git busy living. Miss it all when you say \\"goodnight, goodnight\\".\\n\\n\\n________\\n\\n\\nAuxiliara:\\n\\n\\nApparently Our Town gained wide fame from being featured on `90s TV show Northern Exposure, saw a lotta sad online Gen X\'ers who swear it changed their life. Also more recently in Resident Alien, an all-timer watch-if-you-have-a-steady-girlfriend-show, right after Bake Off. \\n\\n\\nIris is likely best known to this crew for her collaboration with John Prine on In Spite of Ourselves, a great tune, one of the great dumb-as-shit-lovers\' ballads (see also, uh, Nebraska, Somethin\' Stupid, and Idiot Wind). I\'m reliably informed ISoO is coming up in the F+L queue, so no checking it out and spoiling it!\\nTo draw some more F+L connections, here\'s Iris and Emmylou Harris\'s version of Our Town from the Transatlantic Sessions. See also Guy Clark and many more on the session. Plus, the 10K Maniacs version of Let the Mystery Be is pretty fun.\\n\\n\\nWith much love and some regard,\\n\\n\\nOsman R.

He\'s been hanging around the edges (F&L #s 10, 64). Like with Springsteen, I\'m indulging an iffy inclusion, justified by creaky electric fiddle and cosmic circumstance. I got a text from Kevin yesterday that he\'d picked up a copy of Late for the Sky* on cassette from Bull Moose in Portland (Maine). It had a label on it with a name he recognized: my old boss\'s husband, Mal.\\n\\n\\nMal\'s a character and big-time music buff. Judging by his \\"Faves by Faves\\" playlist, he might enjoy some F&L. I figured he\'d get a kick out of Kevin\'s picture, so I sent him an email. Here\'s what he had to say on \\"evolving\\" media.\\n\\n\\n*************\\n\\n\\nHa!  Wow, Matt, that truly takes me back!\\n...\\nI stuck with vinyl thru most of my 20s before switching to cassettes like the one your friend bought. While they had problems -- demagnetization, broken tape (It was not uncommon to see them strewn on roadsides after people would throw malfunctioning ones out their car windows!), you had to keep a pencil handy to stick in one of the 2 holes to rewind it -- there were also upsides: unlike vinyl, they didn\'t skip...  and unlike either vinyl or CD, you could run with them with a Sony Walkman (another much mocked relic from the past that at the time was an awesome must-have!)... and you could make mixed tapes. (Sometimes we taped right off FM radio stations.)\\n\\n\\nAfter accumulating hundreds of cassettes, I was a late adopter when it came to CDs.  Truth be told, given the investment I had made in the cassette business model, I was probably like the horse-and-buggy owner who dismissed Henry Ford\'s Model A as a passing fad.\\n\\n\\nSo, I traded in all my cassettes at Bull Moose (had to be 20 years ago!), bought into the CD model, only to be once again rudely interrupted by the streaming model! Wondering what\'s next? An AI chip implanted in the ear lobe?\\n\\n\\nThanks for passing this along. Kind of like a message in a bottle, makes me wonder if any others will pop up somewhere.\\n\\n\\n*************\\n\\n\\nIt made his/my day.\\n\\n\\n_______________________________\\n\\n\\nSong #161: \\"Ready or Not\\"\\nWho Made it: Jackson Browne\\nYear: 1973\\n_______________________________\\n\\n\\nThoughts: Temps are dropping and hearts are beating in Houston. I had a 2am queue going on Wednesday while the cold front rolled in. The mood persists. I\'ve been scrambled and rolling and wakeful. It\'s a week for feeling, \xe0 la F&L #100  \u2014 engine running clean, funnel open wide, fog dispersed, etc. I\'m stretching my soundtracked morning commutes well past the office, since the days are right for walking. Soak \'em up when you get \'em.\\n\\n\\nJB has more connections to Maine than just Mal\'s tape. Browne name-drops Portland in \\"Nothing But Time\\" (\'Rolling down 295...\'), which he recorded on a bus between Maine and Jersey. I pair \\"Ready or Not\\" with Brunswick.** That\'s where I was when the song first clicked. I must have heard it before then, since I know that I\'d listened through Everyman,*** but the timing wasn\'t right. The day in Brunswick must have been like today: brimming.\\n\\n\\nListen for sound; listen for story; listen for wisdom \u2014 they\'re all there. The intro has some quiet, Allen-ish, boot-clomp percussion under the not-so-subtle scene-setting. It ends with a great, untrue line (\'I guess we\'ll reach some understanding, when we see what the future will bring\') before jumping back in time to a \'typical Hollywood scene.\' It might be our best action sequence for the year:\\n\\n\\nI punched an unemployed actor\\nDefending her dignity\\nWell, he stood up and knocked me through that barroom door\\nAnd that girl came home with me\\n\\n\\nThe scene could be tasteless, but Browne treats it with the right mix of \\"ass-handed-to-him\\" humility and unexpected luck. He wouldn\'t make a convincingly scared father-to-be if he didn\'t pepper in some uneasy jeans jokes. Change is bearing down, and humor cuts the fear \u2014 ever see Knocked Up?^\\n\\n\\nThe chorus gets honest, but not hammy. On her part, the understatement: she says she\'s got a lot on her mind. On his part, the plea:\\n\\n\\nTake a look in my eyes and tell me, brother, \\nIf I look like I\'m ready\\n\\n\\nNo answer \u2014 the title makes the point.\\n\\n\\n\u2013Matt\\n\\n\\n*Great album. My favorite track is \\"Fountain of Sorrow,\\" which isn\'t as sad as it sounds. Some lines that were hitting today:\\n\\n\\nNow, the things that I remember seem so distant, so small\\nThough it hasn\'t really been that long a time\\n\\n\\nI\'m just one or two years and a couple of changes behind you\\nIn my lessons at love\'s pain and heartache school\\n\\n\\nYou could be laughing at me, you\'ve got the right\\nBut you go on smiling so clear and so bright\\n\\n\\nJoan Baez does a good cover.\\n\\n\\n**Bath\'s fancy neighbor with a record store. It\'s called Vinyl-Haven, which is funny if you\'ve spent time in Midcoast Maine. VH and I had a love/hate relationship, depending on who was working when I went there.\\n\\n\\n***Great album. On my physical copy, there\'s a window cut out from the front cover. When the record sleeve is inside, you see the scene (at right below) with JB present. When you take the sleeve out, the same picture\'s there (left), but with JB gone \u2014 a neat trick.\\n\\n\\n JB_Everyman.jpg \\n\\n\\n^Features another favorite song: \\"Daughter\\".","artistWiki":"https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=149564","albumWiki":"https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=1087958","relatedArtists":{"album":["Jackson Browne","Spooner Oldham","Bill Payne","David Paich","Elton John","Joni Mitchell","Mike Utley","Craig Doerge","David Lindley","Sneaky Pete Kleinow","Doug Haywood","Leland Sklar","Wilton Felder","Mickey McGee","Jim Keltner","Gary Mallaber","Russ Kunkel","Don Henley","Glenn Frey","Bonnie Raitt","David Crosby"],"other":["Jackson Browne","Glenn Frey","Joni Mitchell","David Lindley","Doug Haywood","Bonnie Raitt","David Crosby","Don Henley"]}},{"number":162,"song":"Sugar Cane","artist":"Ox","album":"Dust Bowl Revival","spotifyLink":"https://open.spotify.com/track/7zVDgwDCxC4wesn0nn52nu","textBody":"10-18-2024: Sugar Cane\\n\\n\\nFan favorites are back for a third entry.\\n_______________________________\\n\\n\\nSong #162: \\"Sugar Cane\\"\\nWho Made it: Ox\\nYear: 2005\\n_______________________________\\n\\n\\nThoughts: The past couple days were hefty.

Maybe it\'s clean-cut to some of you, but I get mixed up. The mystery starts in the intro:\\n\\n\\nIt was a thousand dollar wedding\\nSupposed to be held the other day and\\nWith all the invitations sent\\nThe young bride went away\\n\\n\\n\'Went\' is unspecific. To me, it sounds like cold feet and a jilting. That would fit with the note-passing in the audience (as word spread) and the subsequent bender. It\'s the less tragic of the two main options*, but still makes for a \'bad, bad day.\'\\n\\n\\nIf you accept the jilting hypothesis, though, you have to explain the funeral lines. It takes some work to fit them together. The line \'And why ain\'t there a funeral, if you\'re gonna act that way?\' could be some goading from the groom to the somber crowd, along the lines of \\"quit crying and start drinking.\\" That could work, but the third verse is tricky. If the bride did run off on the groom, I don\'t think a priest would come out to praise her \'holy face\'. It makes more sense to consider an actual funeral \u2014 but whose?\\n\\n\\nHere\'s my proposal: two separate incidents. Verses one and two describe the jilting. Verse three describes a funeral, but not the bride\'s. They\'re in the same song \u2014 the runaway bride and the deceased \u2014 because they share a bond: neither got enough.\\n\\n\\nRoll back to verse one. Put yourself in the groom\'s shoes. When you realize your girl might not show, what do you do? Maybe you wonder why you didn\'t spring for something nicer: where are the flowers for my baby? A thousand dollars isn\'t much of a budget, after all. Generalize \'flowers\' to loving acts, and we can fill in a reason for why he\'s alone.\\n\\n\\nImportant point: the groom is not the narrator (I hate to tell you how he acted...). This makes the separate situations more workable. The narrator could be some nameless attendee, a friend, or \u2014 if you\'re feeling fancy \u2014 the church. They\'re a witness to two sad scenes. The third verse is a funeral, but was supposed to be a Funeral, i.e. something more special. \\n\\n\\nAgain, where are the flowers for the girl?\\n\\n\\nThe caveat: it should be confusing. There\'s more life to something that\'s open. Make your own guesses, revise, and listen again.

I hope \\"EMR\\" doesn\'t hold any sore memories for those of you who went through that.\\n\\n\\nFirst thing this morning, I thought about my dream. I was at a Wayne\'s-esque deli on the east coast. I ordered a hot-dog*, ate it, then went out to get my card. I had a few sub-dreams before going back to the deli to pay. In the meantime, they\'d charged me for $96 worth of sandwiches. Store policy \u2014 they thought I\'d walked out on them.\\n\\n\\nTake that as a non-example of the dreams in \\"EMR\\". The League\'s \'first light morning feeling\' and \'summer wind\' don\'t have much to do with gas station scams. Their morning \u2014 per F&L #157 \u2014 \'shines with the lights of love\'. Frontman Craig Fuller has a sunny, clear voice (daw-un, sumerrrr win), and the left guitar glitters: hear the strums at 0:19, 0:32, 0:37, etc. You ought to crack a smile.\\n\\n\\nVerse two introduces a semi-villain and rival, \'some other loving sunshine brother\'. In my mind, it\'s Ray from \\"Operator.\\" There\'s some told-you-so resentment from the narrator, which eventually gives way to a short, frustrated bridge:\\n\\n\\nWell you can stand right there and tell me something\'s wrong\\nIt\'s so hard to know your problems when you\'re gone\\n\\n\\nHard indeed. The last chorus (\'I\'ll forget that feeling\') reminds me of last Sunday\'s song.\\n\\n\\n\\"EMR\\" is 60% body and 40% outro, which could put it in third (after \\"Gone Tomorrow\\" (F&L #100) and \\"5 Days in May\\" (F&L #60)). More importantly, we get some bonus outro: listen to how it starts to fade around 4:05 then comes back in. I like to think that, in the studio, they got to the end and started to quiet things down. Then, the guitarist (either Fuller or George Ed Powell, not sure) got on a hot streak, shook the cues off, and kept cookin\'. That might not make sense with the recording process, but the idea makes me happy.\\n\\n\\nAlternatively, the fade out/in could be a deliberate nod to the on-again/off-again love affair that shows up in \\"EMR\\" and the next couple tracks  \u2014 more on that later.\\nReturning to the dream: don\'t diminish your day.\\n\\n\\n\u2013Matt\\n\\n\\n*Keep the Freud comments to yourselves.","artistWiki":"https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=532032","albumWiki":"https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=1133115","relatedArtists":{"album":["Craig Fuller","George Ed Powell","William Frank Hinds","Michael Connor","James Rolleston","Al Brisco","Mick Ronson","Dianne Brooks"],"other":["Craig Fuller","Al Brisco","Michael Connor","Mick Ronson"]}},{"number":171,"song":"Barrier Reef","artist":"Old 97\'s","album":"Too Far To Care","spotifyLink":"https://open.spotify.com/track/7LDa61MEoQEeKKolxn4tgE","textBody":"10-27-2024: Barrier Reef\\nGonna catch the Old 97\'s show two weeks from today at the same spot as Steve.

Catch Miller\'s strum technique when he sings \'workin\' on a broken, workin\' on a broken, workin\' on a broken man.\' Not a full windmill, but he makes do with the space he has.\\n\\n\\nThe pre-chorus exchange usually gets a chuckle from me:\\n\\n\\nShe said, \\"Do you have a car?\\" \\nAnd I said, \\"Do I have a car?\\"\\n\\n\\n(pause)\\n\\n\\nWhat\'s so great about the Barrier Reef?\\nWhat\'s so fine about art?\\n\\n\\nIt\'s good timing: functional question --\x3e semi-functional, equal response --\x3e implication laden delay --\x3e loud, unanswerable rhetoricals.

Back to back with \\"Barrier Reef,\\" it shows the breadth of genre.

Wolf\'s voice is yards past most. You could, but shouldn\'t, take it down easy. Scrape past the prettiness. Come for the tune; stay for the musings.\\n\\n\\n\\"AGD\\" looks back (resp. ahead) at (resp. to) change, likely from amid it. Maybe it\'d be too on the nose to say \\"watershed moment,\\" but that\'s the sort of thing I mean. Put it in slight contrast with the \\"ratchet clicks\\" I had in mind for \\"The Promise\\" (F&L #142). Wolf\'s change seems more detached: a shift, not a snap, something you feel after the fact. Unless the GIS-ers want to prove me wrong, I\'d assume this is what it\'d be like to move from one side of the GD to the other. You wouldn\'t look down and know it had happened, but after a while you\'d see the difference.

It adds up to be heady and keen.\\n\\n\\nThere\'s sleight-of-hand in the third verse: the lyrics dive while the band jams.

I meant to give \\"Desperados\\" a full-treatment, but I got caught up pursuing robustness. For some context*, you should watch this video, where Clark plays a bit, describes his work routine, and outlines the story behind \\"Desperados.\\" He has good take on the intersection of inspiration and discipline in (song)-writing:\\n\\n\\n\\"There\'s magic involved, but you\'ve gotta be...you gotta be here with your guitar tuned and your pencil sharp...and then let the magic happen.\\"\\n\\n\\nClark wrote \\"Desperados\\" about Jack Prigg, an old man from his childhood who acted as a de facto father while Clark\'s real one was fighting in WWII. Here\'s a picture of Jack (big) and Guy (small):\\n\\n\\n GC_JP.png \\n\\n\\nIf I\'d made time to write yesterday, too many listens might\'ve thrown off my Friday vibe. It\'s a better song for a slow day when you\'ve got the bandwidth to haul up memories. The reverence/confusion/indignance in this line stands out:\\n\\n\\nWell to me he\'s one of the heroes of this country\\nSo why\'s he all dressed up like them old men\\n\\n\\nIt\'s hard to watch role models fade \u2014 one of those \\"know it, but don\'t feel it until you see it\\" situations, full of offensive impermanence. \\n\\n\\nIt reminds me of a story: when I was five, I had a friend who was six. I was looking forward to my birthday because I wanted to be the same age as him. I told him the good news on the day, then learned that he\'d turned seven in the meantime \u2014rotten luck. I\'d forgotten that everyone else was getting older, too. \\n\\n\\nSilly, maybe, but the feeling still gets me. Six to seven isn\'t too bad, but it adds up:\\n\\n\\nAnd then the day before he died, I went to see him\\nI was grown and he was almost gone\\nSo we just closed our eyes and dreamed us up a kitchen\\nAnd sang another verse to that old song\\n\\"Come on, Jack, that son of a bitch is coming\\"\\nAnd we\'re desperados waiting for a train\\n\\n\\nJohn Henry knows the feeling.\\n_______________________________\\n\\n\\nSong #177: \\"High Water\\"\\nWho Made it: Uncle Tupelo\\nYear: 1993\\n_______________________________\\n\\n\\nThoughts: Downer double header. There\'s some thematic overlap between \\"Desperados\\" and \\"High Water\\": \\n\\n\\nWe can\'t seem to find common ground\\nI can see the sand and it\'s running out\\nIt was only circumstances\\nBut it\'s the difference\\nIt gets in the way\\nNo race is run in this direction\\nYou can\'t break even\\nYou can\'t even quit the game\\n\\n\\nJesus. That won\'t get you rolling, but it has its moments. Anodyne was the last Tupelo album before the Farrar vs. Tweedy split up, which makes the \'common ground\' line extra pertinent in hindsight. It\'s exhausting, exhausted, and lovely.\\n\\n\\nNote the high-quality pedal playing \u2014 maybe the best yet? Recurring F&L fringe-member Lloyd Maines did the honors.. He grew up in Lubbock and played/plays in Terry Allen\'s Panhandle Mystery Band.*** Here\'s a picture of them at the Lubbock on Everything release concert (Maines left, Allen right):\\n\\n\\n LM_TA.jpg \\n\\n\\nWhen you listen to a concert recording** of \\"High Water,\\" it sounds almost the same as it does on the album (sans Lloyd).

I\'m planning a \\"mid-year review\\" for next Saturday. If the spirit moves you, it could be a good week to listen through the back catalog. Generate some comments/anecdotes/favorites and I\'ll shout \'em out.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nI\'m tapping in for some GW today \u2014 can\'t let KD have all the fun. It\'s too late now for a Sunday nap, but Welch\'s music is perfect for those (in a good way). Keep that in mind for next week.\\r\\nKevin mentioned that I love singing Welch, which is true. \\"OMD\\" is one of my go-tos. I got on the Gill train in the fall of 2018 (a previously mentioned formative time). She\'d been on my radar. The summer before, she played a show in Hanover. I missed it. I can\'t find videos or anything much online, but I found proof that it happened in a pdf of an old Hop program:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n GW_Proof.png \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThat summer, I was taking a writing class with William \\"Baller Bill\\" Craig. He\'d been in a motorcycle accident and couldn\'t walk until his legs got better. I ended up with a gig helping him get to our third floor classroom: I\'d fetch a mobility scooter from a hiding spot in the library, guide* it down an elevator and outside to meet him, then open doors and push elevator buttons for him on the way to class.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nI liked the scooter trips: they gave me good chances to pick Bill\'s brain for wisdom. One day, we went by a poster advertising the GW show. He stopped to look at it and told me that she wrote \\"one of the best lines ever written\\" \u2014 not in \\"OMD,\\" but in a song we\'ll get to later. The GW literate can try to guess in advance which one he meant.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother memory from Bill\'s class: I was daydreaming about a pair of crushes, fanning mental flames and weighing wishful options. There\'s nothing unordinary about that, but the moment struck a chord: all possible joie de vivre came right down on me. It was a great summer, and that was a nexus \u2014 not the best moment, but the most conscious. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSomething similar happened two Fridays ago when I was sitting in a 4:00pm seminar. I had more attention on my beer and thoughts than whatever was on the board. Sure enough, the same feeling** came around \u2014 must be the right direction.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n_______________________________\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSong #178:  \\"One More Dollar\\"\\r\\nWho Made it: Gillian Welch\\r\\nYear: 1996\\r\\n_______________________________\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThoughts: Got a little sidetracked in the intro. GW\'ll do that. \\"OMD\\" is from her first album. Plotwise, \\"Dollar\\" comes pretty close to \\"Tecumseh Valley\\" (F&L #85). I think it\'s fair to assume some amount of cross-pollination: watch this interview to hear about GW and DR opening for TVZ and how he influenced them. They play a good cover of \\"Snowin\' on Raton.\\"\\r\\nWelch puts a lot of magic into the third verse:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA long time ago I left my home\\r\\nJust a boy passing twenty\\r\\nCould you spare a coin and a Christian prayer\\r\\nFor my luck has turned against me\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAmazing third line vocals \u2014 maybe our best \'and\'? I\'m past \'passing twenty\', but losing luck isn\'t any easier now than it was then.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThroughout, the hope\'s the kicker. Welch\'s boy seems sure he\'s almost done, almost home. One more dollar. We, outside, see the slump. We see the downward trend. We hope he\'s right but have our doubts.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHappy ending: I claim, based on lyrical subtlety, that he makes it out. Observe the end of the first three choruses:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I reach those hills, boys, I\'ll never roam\\r\\n\'Cause one more dollar and I\'m going home\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, the song\'s last lines:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen I reach those hills, boys, I\'ll never roam\\r\\n\'Cause one more dollar and I\'m going home\\r\\nOne more dollar\\r\\nBoys, I\'m going home\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe extra lines matter.

Now that we\'re past the midpoint, it\'ll be good to look back. I\'ve been listening through the list, trying to distill some pillars. I put those below in a trio of trios. With each, I put a few songs that speak to the point.\\n\\n\\nAfter that, I thought about the other bits: the process, the writing, the thinking. I couldn\'t/wouldn\'t reflect on the project without reflecting on my days, so there\'s some of that too.\\nLastly, there\'s the song, which is a favorite.\\n\\n\\n*****************************************\\n\\n\\nFair assumption: someone worked hard on these. They turned something foggy into something solid. They compact and encrypt and engage with constraints. On our end, we take the lump and digest it. We work it around and tease out strands. It\'s better to work in batches: shaking one rock won\'t make as much dust as banging a few together.\\n\\n\\nWe have a full barrel. After twenty-six weeks of tumbling, you\'d hope to glean some wisdom. I\'ve had themes floating around in my head for a while, informed by heuristic tallies and trends. I sat down this morning and picked nine standouts: three things to avoid, three to feel, and three to do.\\n\\n\\nGleanings Pt 1: Recurring Pitfalls\\n\\n\\nIf half the thing is fussin\', we ought to know its names. These are a few. They contain many woes. They run in tandem with good things, which makes them hard to dodge. Inevitable pain is pain nonetheless.\\n* \\"Sleeping on Hold\\"-ism: This is the issue I\'ve gone after most. It turned up early and kept coming back. It\'s a problem with living on mute. You could hit mute deliberately (as in \\"Flatness\\") or gradually (as in \\"SoH\\"). You lose agency and amplitude. I cite \\"TGWDO\\" and \\"AtGD\\" as examples of folks getting past the mutedness, waking up, and taking the reins.\\nSongs of Reference: Flatness, Sleeping on Hold, The Girl Who Danced Oklahoma, Across the Great Divide\\n* PSWS: Aka \\"pleasuring self with sadness.\\" I took the phrase from East of Eden, which got into my spine this summer. It\'s a tricky issue and an easy trap \u2014 in the wrong light, it looks fine. I see PSWS cropping up two ways. The first is the usual sad-bastardry and self-pity that\'s easy to spot, which I think is less harmful. Everyone wallows.\\nThe second, more hurtful version sneaks in as virtue. What I mean: consider \\"ample life,\\" full of ups and downs, as an opposite to SoH-ism. Under that scheme, there\'s good value in bad times, taken as part of the full, conscious package. If you take that idea too far, though, and you get too conscious of the \\"good in bad\\" idea, the whole thing crumbles. You bleach the blues.\\n\\n\\nSadness should be ignorant. Fuss in earnest, not in quotes.\\n\\n\\nSongs of Reference: Right in Time, Cigarette Machine, Salome, Lioness, Tearjoint\\n* Overpolish: This is a musical pitfall with a human counterpart. Overproduction makes a song bland. Some quirks and roughness add barbs, widen the envelope, and catch interest. To this point, some of the moments I\'ve liked most are voice cracks, odd phrases, and risks \u2014 the notes that hit the heart. The human counterpart to overproduction is hyper-improvement, i.e. fixating on development at the cost of freedom. Routine and moderation are fine, but shouldn\'t outcrowd whim and excess.\\nSongs of Reference: Player, The Living Bubba, Cowgirl in the Sand\\n\\n\\nGleanings Pt 2: Fine-Grained Emotion\\n\\n\\nHere\'s something obvious worth noting: the song/emotion street runs both ways. I sketched a diagram in #75 that forgot the role of feeling in writing. Since songs incite feelings, they also catalog them. Having a good stock of nuanced media can help pin-down nuanced emotions. I mean something like these posters:\\n\\n\\nbut more like this:\\n\\n\\n Album_Board.jpg \\n\\n\\nThe advantage here is that the extra musical dimensions detect/define emotions that are hard to name. The more you hear them, the more you recognize them. Here are some big ones:\\n* Highway Kinded-ness: Not just rambling, not just restless. It has more to do with a bet on what\'s next. Sometimes we live for ourselves; sometimes we live for others. By and large, most folks shift from the former toward the latter as they go along. Highway Kinded-ness is hard to bring along. The song that does the best job explaining the issue isn\'t on our list, so I\'ll link it (\\"Against the Wind\\"*) and trust you to listen.\\nSongs of Reference: Return of the Grievous Angel, (High, Low And In Between), Leave the City, She Ain\'t Going Nowhere, Amarillo Highway, Someday\\n* Unknowability of Other; Incommunicability of Self: This is a frustration and central fear. We worry that we can\'t bridge the gap, from them to us or us to them. The best songs succeed, but still feel afraid. Can normal folks keep up?\\nSongs of Reference: Why She\'s Acting this Way, Tennessee Rose, The Promise, Far from Me, Ready or Not\\n* The Cosmic Funnel: See F&L #100 in particular for more on this. It\'s a feeling of subtle significance that swells up and chokes you. It\'s elusive and grand and a sign of good living. It sits in your throat and ribs and eyes. It\'s the opposite of SoH-ism.\\nSongs of Reference: Hands on the Wheel, Slice of Life, That Old Time Feeling, Gone Tomorrow\\n\\n\\nGleanings Pt 3: Modes of Action\\n\\n\\nPracticalities: can we put this to use? What does \\"alt-country\\" offer to help us live well? \\"Guiding Principles\\" would be a stretch, but \\"useful lessons\\" feels right. If you\'re stuck or pitfallen, try one of these:\\n* Taking it Pretty Far: FBOFW, I\'ve absorbed \\"Crowbar\\". \'You can take it pretty far on a prayer that\'s pale and synthetic\' has been a recurring tagline. Don\'t overdo it, but you need some of these to move the rig forward. It\'s an instance of itchin\', of spirit leading the charge. You can also take it pretty far on something sturdy and natural, but those are hard to come by.\\nSongs of Reference: Big Brown Eyes, Crowbar, To Beat the Devil, Long Time Gone\\n* Falling (and Flying): This goes hand-in-hand with taking it pretty far, which often entails a fall. I\'ll re-link two of the best non-listable songs: \\"When You Come Back Down\\" and \\"Gone For Good.\\" As it happens, Jeff Bridges has a movie where he plays a Waylon-ish washup and sings a song called \\"Fallin\' and Flyin\'.\\"\\nThe point: some (re)constructive downtime works wonders. Progress through action/reflection. Go home when you can, then leave.\\n\\n\\nSongs of Reference: When I Fall, These Days, Gravity\'s Gone, Wichita, More Than I Can Do\\n* Train Stuff: Here\'s the less glamorous side of growing: the hard work, spit and dirt, bootstraps pull-up  \u2014 the land of the noble John Henrys. The train is a hero (to Snider\'s friend) and omen (to the \\"JRB\\" crew). It\'s rhythm and icon. This is the \\"everyman ideal\\" of discipline, hope, and grit. This is the foundation.\\nSongs of Reference: Shoestrings, Play a Train Song, James River Blues, Little Silver Heart, One More Dollar\\n\\n\\n*****************************************\\n\\n\\nReflection on Process: Halfway came fast. The years don\'t last like they used to.\\nIt\'s been an interesting project. I underestimated the challenge of writing (almost) every day. It didn\'t take long for \\"describing sounds\\" to play itself out \u2014 I hit my \\"twang\\" quota early. I can\'t compete with Wikipedia biographically, and lyrical analysis ends up feeling snooty. Personal connections and anecdotes are fine, but shouldn\'t be the whole thing. Free-form word association is good for one in twenty. I usually try to mix all/most of the above and to throw in some good pictures. I expect the length of emails to polarize as we go: shorter to shorter and longer to longer, with fewer in between.\\n\\n\\nI feel bad when I punt, but I\'d rather make it to the end of the year with a mix of strong days and weak days than to call the thing off. Sometimes the punting comes from honest busyness or unexpected schedule changes. Other times, I don\'t have much to say \u2014 could be that the song\'s less interesting than I thought, or I could just be tired. \\n\\n\\nAs a rule of thumb, the project should be enriching, not distracting. I\'ve converted social-media and streaming hours (and some working hours) into F&L time, but I shouldn\'t prioritize an email over a party, a friend, or a walk.\\n\\n\\nIt\'s all pro bono, so I\'ll do what I want.\\n\\n\\nAnother unexpected challenge: I didn\'t account for my shifting perspective. When I made the list, it felt cohesive. It fit my state of mind. That state of mind, though, was backward facing and reflective. I was picking songs that had emotional attachments from the past few years, mostly from 18F through 23S. I didn\'t plan for change. Last year was pretty \\"head-down, nose in the books,\\" so my thoughts were still behind me. This year, for the better, has made me look around \u2014 new characters, new perspectives. Old loops are out; fresh loops are in, changing what I want to hear and write.\\n\\n\\nThe change crops up in a few ways: I\'ve pushed some songs from the original list downstream when they haven\'t spoken to me. On the other hand, I\'ve slipped in some new ones. Some have held strong: \\"Crowbar\\" was an add-in, and it\'s been crucial. Others not so much: \\"One Promise Too Late\\" was just the thing on its day, but has lost some oomph since then. I don\'t want that to happen too often. I\'m confident that the songs from the original list have lasting power, so, for the most part, I\'m going to stick to them. \\n\\n\\nIt\'s tricky: the distinction between reflective piece, critical piece, and journal gets blurry \u2014 nature of the beast.\\n\\n\\nOther than w.r.t. my schedule, has this project changed my habits? Probably. I\'d say I\'ve been more observant. Having a (self-imposed) obligation to fill an email makes me pay attention to what I think. I\'ve listened to less new music than usual, but I\'ve listened closer. It\'s also been nice to have another egg in my basket, something fulfilling and non-professional. I\'ll be proud if I last \'til May.\\n\\n\\nThere\'ve been some side effects w.r.t. the PSWS phenomenon above. There were a few days not too long ago (#164-169) when I felt pretty glum \u2014 not the issue. Behind the glumness, there was some satisfaction \u2014 the issue. I\'d been preaching the \'thankful for the blues\' line so often that I was (almost) glad they\'d caught me \u2014 not really, but almost. It was uncomfortable, dissonant: I was outside myself. That\'s not the point. Again, sadness should be ignorant, not coated in context. It\'s fine to look back, years down the line, and be thankful for the good times that came by way of bad times, but you shouldn\'t savor misfortune. Things get muddy and stink of infinite genies (pg 121).\\n\\n\\nOverall, though, I\'ve come out ahead. Much more on the way. For now, let\'s get to the song.\\n\\n\\n_______________________________\\n\\n\\nSong #184: \\"Cowboy Song\\"\\nWho Made it: Thin Lizzy\\nYear: 1976\\n_______________________________\\n\\n\\nThoughts: Yee-haw. Someone must have called it. I blundered last night and added this instead of \\"V\\", then caught myself this morning. Maybe no one noticed.\\n\\n\\nEven with a different title, \\"Cowboy Song\\" would be on here.** The energy is crazy. Famously phenomenal bass from Phil. I started writing at 9:00am, it\'s 10:21pm, and I\'m still amped. You can map about half of the preamble above onto the first lines after the riff drops:\\n\\n\\nI am just a cowboy lonesome on the trail\\nLord, I\'m just thinking about a certain female\\nThe nights we spent together riding on the range\\nLooking back it seems so strange\\n\\n\\nGranted, \\"female\\" is an awkward choice, but the spice on \\"Lord\\" makes up for it. Later, we get Texas, another girl, and another spicy \\"Lord\\":\\n\\n\\nI was took in Texas I did not know her name\\nLord, all these southern girls seem the same\\n\\n\\nThe structure is similar to \\"Tennessee Rose\\" \u2014 refer to the diagram in F&L #78. Two feverish solos sandwich a tame (but sexy) interlude, which must be there just to give Scott and Gary time to rest.\\n\\n\\nThe chorus sums it all up:\\n\\n\\nRoll me over and turn me around\\nLet me keep spinning till I hit the ground\\nRoll me over and let me go\\nRiding in the rodeo\\nRoll me over and set me free\\nThe cowboy\'s life is the life for me\\n\\n\\nBig strum and it\'s done. Perfect.\\n\\n\\n\u2013Matt\\n\\n\\n*The Highwaymen do a version, but Seger does it better. \'Moving eight miles a minute for months at a time\' is a hall of fame lyric (and Strava title).\\n\\n\\n**Heavy-hitters agree: note the Thin Lizzy reference at 1:57 in \\"Fifteen Keys\\" from Uncle Tupelo.\\n\\n\\nReply from Kevin Donohue:\\n\\n\\nI\'ll speak for one and speak for all when I say my half-year has been enhanced majorly, and my Sunday by this email. Also I made this a few weeks ago in anticipation for this moment and think it should be the cover photo, if Matt can get over his humility.","artistWiki":"https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=166705","albumWiki":"https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=5416735","relatedArtists":{"album":["Phil Lynott","Scott Gorham","Brian Robertson","Brian Downey"],"other":["Thin Lizzy","Phil Lynott","Scott Gorham","Brian Downey","Brian Robertson"]}},{"number":185,"song":"Don\'t Wanna Know Why","artist":"Whiskeytown","album":"Pneumonia","spotifyLink":"https://open.spotify.com/track/3qpMAhDIMNh5jzRyr7GjBn","textBody":"11-10-2024:  Don\u2019t Wanna Know Why\\n\\n\\n_______________________________\\n\\n\\nSong #185: \\"Don\'t Wanna Know Why\\"\\nWho Made it: Whiskeytown\\nYear: 2001\\n_______________________________\\n\\n\\nThoughts: I\'m heading out to the 97\'s\'s concert in a minute.

I listened at my desk, too, and caught my stare with a book.\\n\\n\\nYesterday (\\"One More Run\\"), we heard bold, certain age: \'if we win we drink sweet wine; if we don\'t it\'s only dying\'. It gave a sense of questions settled and peace well-made \u2014 not so today. Prine was seventy-two in 2018, and admitted his own mystery*:\\n\\n\\nLast night\\nTurned on the TV\\nLooked out the window\\nAnd then pulled down the shade\\nAnd I came to\\nThe conclusion\\nMy mind could not be made\\n\\n\\nHear what I mean with the cadence? It has direction, but doesn\'t quite flow. It\'d be easy to miss his meaning if he got it out smoother. As is, every word sticks.

Still, he holds back:\\n\\n\\nI said it\'s nothing\\nIt\'s just something\\nI picked up as a kid\\n\\n\\nPrime example here of the fine-grained \\"unknowable other/incommunicable self\\" issue. Prine, for all his eloquence, throws up a shell. It\'s nothing. The kid bit is probably true, and also a cop-out. \\nIt\'s unclear to me if he ever gets the words out. The rest of the song might happen in his head, hashed-out post facto. If so, it\'s tragic \u2014 she should\'ve heard this:\\n\\n\\nLast night\\nFor a split sec\\nI was a train-wreck\\nI was a complicated guy\\n\\n\\nThat twists me up. Ain\'t we all complicated?

Shit. Shit wait I think that\'s the wrong song. Save me, Wikipedia disambiguation page.\\n\\n\\nI first encountered \\"Fox on the Run\\" while trawling through the back catalog of singalong songs from the Dartmouth Outing Club. Later I\'d find it on some compilation album in the South Portland Bull Moose to give to Matt as a hosting gift.\\n\\n\\nIt was written in \'68 by songwriter Tony Hazzard, recorded in \'68 by Mannfred Mann*, and then covered by Tom T. here as a single in \'76. Listening to the original, I\'m a fan, but this song is yearning for a country version. It was quickly picked up by bluegrass acts as a standard**, and Tom T. puts his version down before us today.\\n\\n\\nThere\'s not much to be said for this song that clocks in as second-shortest so far (Friday\'s byrdsong comes in one second shorter). It\'s a full 44 seconds shorter than the original. That\'s an URGENT fiddle to start us off\u2014a fiddle on the run.

It\'s the first of 107 from Townes. Try to hear why. Van Zandt\'s guitar (as Eli pointed out on #106) is strong enough to match his lyrics. \\"Columbine\\"* has some of his best playing:** It\'s warm and breezy, but not shallow \u2014 sticks in your chest along with your head. There\'s extra warmth on \\"Columbine\\" because most of it (fingerstyle guitar, bongos, harmonica) gets played by hand/mouth, with no picks/sticks to get between the maker and the music.\\n\\n\\nA lesson I learned in my coaching days: challenge and support should come in equal parts. Don\'t expect better if you won\'t help it happen. Seems like Van Zandt knows this, so he pairs hard truths with care:\\n\\n\\nAh lady like the flower fair\\nSomeday you\'ll have to fall\\nAnd you can find me standin\' there\\nTo catch you if you call\\n\\n\\nRecall the Van Zandt/Earle partnership. I\'d guess that Steve took inspiration for at least two different songs from that verse. One is \\"When I Fall\\" (F&L #135), and the other will show up later.\\nOn the \\"hard truths\\" front, I think about this line a lot:\\n\\n\\nNow all your pride and prancing\\nHow much does it mean?\\n\\n\\nIn a Prine-ish, mind-unmade/unmakeable way, I think there\'s much I\'d like to do and little I\'d like to be.*** That clashes with the pride drive: lots of little \\"done\\" piles don\'t carry clout like one big \\"is\\" badge. It isn\'t clear to me what I mean, but I think I\'m on the right side of it. The story matters more than the headline. Acting too be-centricly can put you in a bind, shunting harvests down a lengthening line. There\'s peril in forbearance:\\n\\n\\nAll the livin\' that you\'re savin\'\\nWon\'t buy your dreams for you\\n\\n\\nFor such a gentle song, that\'s a hard call-out. I\'d guess it comes from kindness. There\'s a recurring feeling in Van Zandt\'s songs that he can\'t stand for the folks around him to miss the beauty that he sees. Compare the lyrics in \\"Columbine\\" to this standout line from \\"If I Needed You\\" (F&L #157):\\n\\n\\nYou will miss sunrise if you close your eyes\\nAnd that would break my heart in two\\n\\n\\nBoth songs are full of affection. It comes up in sharing, in breathing, in breaking. It comes up in giving and taking hard advice. The platitude is to \\"stop and smell the flowers,\\" but there\'s more than that happening. The key line (\'All the livin\'...\') warns against waiting your way to joy. Goodness isn\'t finite, and it doesn\'t earn interest under glass. Use the nice spices before they lose their flavor.\\n\\n\\n\u2013Matt\\n\\n\\n*State flower of Colorado, where TVZ used to spend his summers.\\n\\n\\n TVZ_Colum.jpg \\n\\n\\n**I\'ve tried a couple times to learn to play the guitar part, but it\'s beyond me.

The time is Winter 2022; the place is between Bath, ME and Pineland Farms. I\'d put Steve on when I\'d drive out to ski. The skis (long and loopy) were good distractions from some frustrations that cropped up around then (e.g. a full slate of \\"no\\"s on my first round of grad school apps). I\'d do my laps, grab a kombucha, then sing along through the ride back \u2014 a great combo for blowing off steam.\\n\\n\\nWhen I hear Steve\'s version of \\"I\'m Looking Through You,\\" I think of this intersection (but with more snow):\\n\\n\\n Soper_125.png \\n\\n\\nWith \\"intersections\\" in mind, here\'s some web-building. Train A Comin\' has more of a bluegrass sound than Earle\'s earlier (Earle-ier?) albums*. Some legends chipped in: Norman Blake and Peter Rowan** play the dobro/mandolin on \\"ILTY\\". Blake should be familiar for a few reasons. First, there\'s this line from Gillian Welch\'s \\"Wayside/Back In Time\\", which Kevin covered on F&L #50:\\n\\n\\nOh I wish was in \'Frisco\\nIn a brand new pair of shoes\\nI\'m sittin\' here in Nashville\\nWith Norman\'s Nashville Blues\\n\\n\\nWelch and Blake both contributed to the soundtrack for O Brother, Where Art Thou?, which is dense with F&L connections.*** Also featured: Allison Krauss (#166), Emmylou Harris (many #s), John Hartford (#131), and The Fairfield Four (who sang on Steve\'s \\"Telephone Road,\\" #6). If that weren\'t enough, T-Bone Burnett produced the whole thing.\\n\\n\\nNo lyrics today \u2014 not gonna bring my knife to the Beatle-manic gunfight.

We\'re checking all the boxes today: heartache, sleepless fits, mothers/brothers, open arms and envy. I saved a cup of coffee, I\'ve got laundry in the dryer, and I\'m in the mood to dig.\\n\\n\\nGetting this out of the way: \\"Down to Zero\\" sounds amazing. Listen with your best setup.* You should have it loud enough that the big electric bursts (used sparingly) get close to uncomfortable. The piano works magic. The pedal solo at 2:14 is a highlight: B.J. Cole played in fine form. Live versions I\'ve seen try to emulate the sound with \\"normal\\" guitars \u2014 they always fall short.\\n\\n\\nSpeaking of live versions: try this one from \'76. Take time to listen and watch. Hear the little guitar lick after \'...walked the warm sand beside you\' and see Joan feel it. \\"Performance\\" seems like the wrong word for what\'s happening. She\'s strumming and singing, but she\'s also going through it \u2014 her face shows it all, especially at the end. It looks more like she\'s reacting to her own song (and memories, and hopes) than putting on a show.\\n\\n\\nWhat memories/hopes do I mean? Hers I don\'t know, but  \u2014 as a fellow human \u2014 I get the gist. Here\'s the full verse:\\n\\n\\nOh remember who walked the warm sands beside you\\nMoored to your heel let the waves come a rushing in\\nShe took the worry from your head\\nBut then again\\nShe put trouble in your heart instead\\nThen you\'ll fall\\nDown to the ground\\nDown to the ground\\n\\n\\nI\'ll nominate \'but then again\' for most loaded coordinating phrase of the year. The head/heart dynamic is classic.** It\'s the trade you need to make, trouble and pain be damned. \\"Trade\\" and \\"need\\" are the wrong words anyway, since nothing here\'s optional. Joan bakes that into the grammar: it\'s all \\"will\\"s and \\"when\\"s. She sounds like a prophet:\\n\\n\\n You\'ll know heartache\\nStill more crying\\nWhen you\'re thinking of your mother\'s only son\\nTake to your bed\\nYou say there\'s peace in sleep\\nBut you\'ll dream of love instead\\n\\n\\n\\"Prophet\\" is also a wrong word. \\"Sibling\\" might be better. This is not a cosmic drama, if there even is such a thing. It\'s a personal/universal experience that kicks your ass. It puts you in bed, torn ten ways, quizzing and hashing and hoping and shaking. It makes you sweat and moan.\\n\\n\\nBut then again, it makes you better \u2014 more honest, more known, more willing to know. The chorus gets back to F&L #135 (\\"When I Fall\\"), but from the other side. It commands and insists on the privilege of care:\\n\\n\\nBut oh when you fall\\nOh when you fall\\nFall at my door\\n\\n\\nAgain, it\'s when. There\'s no unkindness here, no hope for misfortune \u2014 just assurance that when the hard times come, you\'ll have a place to go.\\n\\n\\nYou can\'t say more than that.\\n\\n\\nReturning to the concert video: maybe some of the rawness came from the song\'s newness \u2014 salt in fresh wounds. Maybe later performances would lose the luster. To quash that notion, try this solo rendition from 2018. As before, watch her after the \'warm sand\' line. I guarantee that someone comes to her mind every time, and that she remembers right along with us. \\n\\n\\nI don\'t catch a lick of the jadedness or separation you might expect after singing the song for forty years. If anything, it put down deeper roots in the years between. It\'s beautiful to see the song grow up: every worry/trouble/dream/love gets stacked with others \u2014 not many, but a few. \\nThe big feelings we get here aren\'t everyday things. They aren\'t \\"once-in-a-lifetime\\" either. The gaps between are long enough that they might seem singular, but that\'s an illusion of flattened futures.\\n\\n\\nPlurality cheapens nothing. The first \\"First Cut\\" need not be the deepest.\\n\\n\\n\\"The feelin\' when you\'re reelin\' \\" would make a good title for a sentimental fishing podcast.\\n\\n\\n\u2013Matt\\n\\n\\n*I\'ve got this one on record. \\"DtZ\\" is the first song on its side, which makes it much easier to queue up for back-to-back (-to-back-to-back) listenings.\\n\\n\\n**Reminds me of Prine\'s \\"Bruised Orange (Chain of Sorrow)\\", which probably won\'t get its own slot this year, but has this great verse:\\n\\n\\nI been brought down to zero,^ pulled out and put back there\\nI sat on a park bench, kissed the girl with the black hair\\nAnd my head shouted down to my heart\\n\\"You better look out below!\\"\\n\\n\\n^On my life, I didn\'t plan the \\"down to zero\\" overlap.

We\'ve had a couple other entries from The Gourds (#62 and #139), but this one\'s my favorite. Instead of the stream-of-consciousness/semi-nonsense lyrics of \\"Dying of the Pines\\" and \\"Caledonia\\", we get something lucid. As frontman Kevin Russell puts it, \\"This is, uh, sort of a love song. It\'s about . . . a woman\'s love for prescription medicine . . . and a man\'s love for that woman.\\"\\n\\n\\nClearly, no Disney-tale. There\'s a big scoop of roughness. Consider ends/means:\\n\\n\\nJust let me know if you\'re feelin\' sad\\nEven if you\'re feelin\' like stealing\'s bad\\nI don\u2019t like to steal you know it\u2019s true\\nBut I don\'t mind if I steal for you*\\n\\n\\nAs explication-via-negation, this is not what Joni wanted. The \\"best\\" is long gone, traded for whatever keeps the ship afloat. \\n\\n\\nWhen you hear Russell sing the chorus, though, it\'s hard to begrudge any compromise:\\n\\n\\nYou just gotta stay right where you are\\nIf you go anywhere don\u2019t go too far\\n\'Cause I get lonely, and I get down\\nBaby I can\u2019t have you out runnin\' round\\n\\n\\nIt doesn\'t much sound like he wants to do wrong. Entangled motives eat him up. The plainness of \'I get lonely, and I get down\' gives it extra heft** \u2014 there\'s no rhetoric to muddle the meaning. The thieving/enabling narrator gets caught in his dependency, accepting some ugliness to safeguard something special. It\'s not ideal, but it\'s what he\'s got.\\n\\n\\nThe dissonance shows up in the arrangement, too. It would be less effective if it were uniformly nice. In the left ear, there\'s a bristly telecaster, giving its usual grit. In the right, there\'s a lepidopterous mandolin, clean and flighty. Take it as a \\"one on each shoulder\\" situation.\\n\\n\\nThe two acoustic solos (mandolin at 2:10 and fiddle at 3:14) are prettier than you\'d expect.

It serves a purpose in the larger arc. As a whole may be greater than the sum of its parts, so may the greatest whole be greater than the whole corresponding to the sum of the greatest parts.\\n_______________________________\\n\\n\\nSong #201: \\"Song for Adam/Shadow Dream Song\\"\\nWho Made it: Gregg Allman\\nYear: 1973\\n_______________________________\\n\\n\\nThoughts: We\'ll pivot from yesterday. On \\"FotM\\", I counted eight different instruments and a pair of voices \u2014 on \\"SfA/SDS\\", just one of each.* We\'ve dropped the cinematic pageantry, but we\'re still in the same tradition. Gregg Allman (as one of the Allman Brothers) was a southern-rock luminary \u2014 listen to At Filmore East if you need convincing. He busted his share of speakers, but that\'s not the point. It was a quiet day, so here\'s a quiet song.\\n\\n\\nIf you\'re an on-again-off-again reader/listener, check back on F&Ls #64 (\\"These Days\\") and #161 (\\"Ready or Not\\") before launching into this one. They have some context on Gregg Allman/Jackson Browne (and were two of my favorites to write).\\n\\n\\nThe JB context is important because he wrote \\"Song for Adam\\" (a heartbreaker** in its own right, which shows up at the start of today\'s track) and \\"Shadow Dream Song\\". Browne put \\"Adam\\" on his debut album, but never recorded \\"Shadow\\". Allman graced us with both.\\n\\n\\nRecall the closing line from \\"These Days\\":\\n\\n\\nPlease don\'t confront me with my failures. \\nI\'m aware of them.\\n\\n\\nAs the NYT article that came out two months after my writeup points out, JB wrote those lines (or his version of them) at the formidable age of sixteen. The article has a quote from Jimmie Fadden (Nitty Gritty Dirt Band) that pokes fun at the \'failures\' of a sixteen year old, but we ought not dismiss the youths \u2014 their troubles are also big.\\n\\n\\nTwo years later, at eighteen, Browne wrote \\"Shadow\\", which begins with \'failures\' we\'ve felt:\\n\\n\\nI meant to call her name\\nI meant to take her hand\\nI meant to be the same and understand\\n\\n\\nIt\'s hard to bear mismatched intentions and actions, particularly in the past-tense. If you trust YouTube comment sections (which you maybe shouldn\'t), Browne wrote \\"Shadow\\" after meeting and falling for Pamela Polland. Then, as one should, he shared his song with a friend. Allman took Browne\'s writing and did it justice (even on a demo, buried deep on the D-side*** of a posthumous re-release).\\n\\n\\nHere\'s the best bit:\\n\\n\\nI can\'t be bothered now\\nI cannot eat or drink\\nI can\'t remember how I used to think\\n\\n\\nYouch. Simple words, but they leave some space for bending. I could see \'I can\'t be bothered now\' two different ways, with two different feelings:\\n* \\"I\'m above all bothers. I\'ve transcended. Great good has found me and I fear no trouble.\\"\\n* \\"I have all the trouble I can stand. Do not bother me. I choose to ignore a painful world.\\"\\nLikewise for \'I can\'t remember how I used to think\':\\n* \\"My thoughts now are unlike my thoughts before. Something has changed my perception. The world is different.\\"\\n* \\"I used to think. Now, I cannot. I produce no thoughts. My mind has fled and left me dry.\\"\\nBest not to pick a \\"right\\" one.^ From Allman\'s somber delivery and general forgetfulness, I\'d lean toward the latter pair, but other interpretations (e.g. Tom Rush) sound more cheery.\\n\\n\\nI took \\"Shadow\\" on a walk today and jotted notes al fresco. It was a good choice for a chilly (sub 60\xb0) day. The emptiness of pre-Thanksgiving campus matched the reverb-expanse of the song. I liked Allman\'s humming, the string smacks, and the inflection on \'drink\' \u2014 good for feelin\' feelins.\\n\\n\\n\u2013Matt\\n\\n\\n*\\"Mr. Bojangles\\" (#52) and \\"If I Could Only Fly\\" (#137) are the only other songs so far in the one-voice/one-guitar category.

Reminder of some context: Suzanna Clark (married to Guy Clark of F&Ls #28, #90, and #176) painted the cover. There\'s a nice picture of her and Emmylou in the entry for \\"She Ain\'t Going Nowhere\\".***\\n\\n\\nAs it happens, \\"LLitBD\\" makes a good counterpart to \\"Nowhere\\". I described the mood on \\"Nowhere\\" as \\"early-morning desperation\\", but \\"LLitBD\\" happens a bit later and with a bit more vigor. It\'s all about the gut:\\n\\n\\nShe sang \\"Never have I known it when it felt so good\\nNever have I knew it when I knew I could\\nNever have I done it when it looked so right\\nLeaving Louisiana in the broad daylight.\\"\\n\\n\\nOf all the nevers, I think \'never have I knew it when I knew I could\' says the most.\\n\\n\\nFittingly, \\"LLitbD\\" has some zydeco^ sounds mixed in. Harris isn\'t from Louisiana, but seems to appreciate the culture.^^ She did \\"Evangeline\\" with The Band, then made an album with the same name. All that goes back to Longfellow\'s poem Evangeline, A Tale of Acadie, so it\'s good that we learned our history.\\n\u2013Matt\\n\\n\\n*First year and second year roommates in Maine.\\n\\n\\n**Readers will remember from F&Ls #37 and #45 that my car\'s stereo is kaput (mostly).

The first is a cover of Guy Clark\'s \\"New Cut Road\\". Harris introduces it by saying \\"We decided to do this song a little different from the way everybody else has done it. So, the most different thing we could think of was an accordion. . . and, uh, Guy Clark is not speaking to me, but we\'re gonna do it anyway.\\"\\n\\n\\nThe second bonus track is \\"LaCassine Special\\" (sung all in French).

It\'s a break from convention, but it\'s the better choice \u2014 more mass, more momentum. You can compare it to the studio recording and see if you agree.\\n\\n\\nWhen you know what to expect, you\'ll appreciate the intro. It gives you time to collect yourself, to take a breath and grit your teeth. When the bass opens up, you\'d better be on board. It\'s not for casual listening.\\n\\n\\n\\"DTLLTD\\" is our fourth from a Jason Molina band (#21, #108, #182). With experience, you might expect some hard hitting lines. The first verse, I think, sounds like a nightmare:\\n\\n\\nSix and a half hours into the West Virginia night\\nHalf a mile from home and I was makin\' pretty good time\\nI thought that I\'d gone far enough, I couldn\'t lose the trail\\nThen I stepped through the door, I still found a way to fail\\n\\n\\nIt\'s scary: not much is sure or set. You wonder how many times he\'s tripped at the finish, and you wonder if you\'re immune.\\n\\n\\nYou aren\'t. You shouldn\'t be. Part of the appeal in something fake, like a video game, is the concrete progress: you gain a level; you keep it. Things in \\"real-life\\" are precarious. You can lose ground; you can fail on the threshold. String a few failures back-to-back and you might question the effort. Why bother with \'six and a half hours\' when \'half a mile\' could blow it?\\n\\n\\nI ask that rhetorically. I don\'t think that \\"DTLLTD\\" is a \\"sad\\" song.* Instead, it\'s lifelike. Van Zandt has a good quote on the distinction, given to a reporter who asked him why most of his songs are sad songs:\\n\\n\\n\\"Well, you know, I don\'t think they\'re all that sad . . . they\'re just the way it goes, kinda . . . you don\'t think life\'s sad.\\"\\n\\n\\nDo we see that here? Back on F&L #21 (\\"Leave the City\\"), Osman replied-all (rare these days) with some ruminations and grim statistics. He referenced a verse from \\"DTLLTD\\" but tactfully omitted the title (anticipating that it might show up later). Here\'s that verse again:\\n\\n\\nNow that big gray owl above me starts again to wail\\nSays that moon has got so low tonight that it\'s polishin\' the rails\\nNow that mountain engine\'s runnin\' about 30 years too late\\nOnce you hear it comin\', boy, it will not let you wait\\n\\n\\nI\'m not sure what a \'mountain engine\' is (maybe a cog-railway?), but I don\'t mind abstracting. I can think of a slew of things that will not let you wait. We answer the rhetoric: you bother when you have to. Things come along that don\'t let you pick. I mean that in the sense of conviction, not of circumstance: quit you could, but quit you won\'t. When you hear it comin\', you\'ve got to see it through.\\n\\n\\nAnother question: where\'s the \\"best\\" place to hear a song? Where would it mean the most? With \\"DTLLTD\\", I\'d guess it\'d hit hardest in its own setting, i.e. \'six and a half hours into the West Virginia night\' \u2014 long at the wheel and far from rest. If you queue it up on a late-night drive, though, be careful. This part will make you speed:\\n\\n\\nTonight when I am rolling over the earth\'s most lonesome ground\\nI will think of all the ways, next time I will try not to let you down\\nI thought that I\'d live long enough\\nThat the light would come shining through\\nBut don\'t this look like the dark?\\n\\n\\nWhere do we find our hero? Back on the road, rolling, and battling past the let-downs. This is where the live cut outshines the studio, especially on \'try not to let you down\'. We can tell from the voice that he\'s out on the line.\\n\\n\\n\u2013Matt\\n\\n\\n*The sad part comes in the last three lines (\'I thought that I\'d...\'). They\'re sad because Molina passed early.

Practically, that means that some of what I would have wanted to use for \\"weekend\\" songs will have to be \\"weekday\\" songs.

I didn\'t point it out last week, but I think that \\"Shadow Dream Song\\" is a terrible name. Great song, but the title stinks like YA fiction. Other bad names include \\"Anniversary Song\\" (#18) and \\"Wayside/Back in Time\\"*** (#50). Good names: \\"A Pirate Looks at Forty\\" (#55), \\"Hell\\" (#122), and \\"She\'s Actin\' Single (I\'m Drinkin\' Double)\\" (#129).\\nI\'d put \\"A Song for You\\" (and similar variations) in the appellative S-tier. I like it because it\'s honest. It\'s consistent with a vision. A (decent) song should have a place to go, and it should put purpose over subject. I mean that if you make something for someone, it\'s good to say that. The song matters less than whoever\'s going to hear it.\\n\\n\\nThat being said, I\'m glad that \\"A Song for You\\" came to us. GP could have kept it to himself and whoever got his gears turning, and we\'d (but maybe not he\'d) be poorer for it. Anyone with respect for the F&L vision ought to listen to the first twelve seconds on loop for a while \u2014 let Al P teach you something.\\n\\n\\n Young_Al_P.jpg \\n\\n\\n(Portrait of the steel guitarist as a young man)\\n\\n\\nSince we\'re stuck with a weeknight (and I got sidetracked on the titles), one verse\'ll have to do. Good thing it\'s a doozy:\\n\\n\\nI\'ve loved you every day and now I\'m leaving\\nAnd I can see the sorrow in your eyes\\nI hope you know a lot more than you\'re believing\\nJust so the sun don\'t hurt you when you cry\\n\\n\\nHere it is again (\'that one look at the end\'). Supply your own context and pick your distance. GP\'s mysteries don\'t numb the sting (of rifts, of restraint, of \'every day\' ending). These thorny pairs \u2014  you/me, believed/known, loving/leaving \u2014 get chopped and splotched. Little walls perplex us. We bank on some understanding to get through the cracks: something to keep in the pocket, something to block the sun. A song is much; a look is more; enough is not itself. \\n\\n\\nWe\'ll pick it up later.\\n\\n\\nAll through \\"ASfY\\", GP and Emmylou\'s voices are close in the headphones (not to each other, but to my ears).

Sturg played it with his old band (Sunday Valley) before his self-named act. This video from 2011 shows an early version (solo with Telecaster). It\'s a different version of Sturg, too, before he had a team to manage his fashion*. He overdoes the high-notes, but I wouldn\'t hold it against him \u2014 it\'s hard to show restraint when your heart runs hot.**\\n\\n\\n\\"Sarah\\" comes seven tracks after \\"Pollywog\\" and one track after \\"All Around You\\" (F&L #181) on Sailor\'s Guide. Take the three together and see where he stands:\\n\\n\\nAnd if sometimes daddy has to go away\\nBut please don\'t think that it means I don\'t love you (\\"Pollywog\\")\\n\\n\\nJust know in your heart\\nThat we\'re always together (\\"All Around You\\")\\n\\n\\nWell there\'s going to be times that I gotta go away\\nBut don\'t worry, baby, I\'ll come home (\\"Oh Sarah\\")\\n\\n\\nOne big wail. Play them back-to-back to hear how \\"All Around You\\" bleeds/beats into \\"Oh Sarah\\". ***\\n\\n\\nNow, think back to \\"No Ordinary Blue\\" (#188). In verse two, Prine\'s proxy almost speaks up, then balks (\'I said it\'s nothing, It\'s just something, I picked up as a kid\'). Here, Sturg follows suit:\\n\\n\\nOh Sarah, here we go again\\nI can\'t get past the pain of what I want to say to you\\nI\'m too old now to learn how to let you in\\nSo I\'ll run away just like I always do\\n\\n\\n\\"Regretful Restraint\\" has been a recurring/emerging theme. It showed up on \\"Blue\\"; it showed up on \\"Shadow\\"; it showed up on \\"A Song For You\\". It shows up today, but with a twist \u2014 Simpson has the sense to show the other side. Here\'s the winning line:\\n\\n\\nWish you\'d speak the words those eyes are trying to say\\n\\n\\n\'One look at the end\', again and again and again. Back to the eyes. \\n\\n\\nThe rest of the song tries to answer the challenge, i.e. speaking the unspoken. What words work? Apologies and curses, mostly:\\n\\n\\nSo forgive me if sometimes I seem a little crazy\\nBut god damn, sometimes crazy\'s how I feel\\n\\n\\nThe \'god damn\' is a rupture, a spilling-over of non-verbal understanding into a blunt tool. It reminds me of this Richard Thompson song \u2014 another tacit burner \u2014 where he gives up on the lyrics and reverts (effectively) back to grunts.^\\n\\n\\nMaybe it works. Maybe it melts the ice. Stu loosens up and cuts to the chase.

Now, he\'s back with a well-deserving deep-cut.\\n\\n\\n\u2013 Matt\\n\\n\\n________________________________________________________\\n\\n\\nGuest Feature from Jack\\n_______________________________\\n\\n\\nSong #211: \\"Breakfast\\"\\nWho Made it: Darrin Bradbury\\nYear: 2019\\n_______________________________\\n\\n\\nThoughts: Deer hunting means thinking about deer when you\'re at work and thinking about squirrels when you\'re hunting. Squirrels are the red herrings of the woods and are indistinguishable from atom bombs when they chase each other on potato chip leaves. Much like the quip about the coldest winter Mark Twain ever spent being a summer in San Francisco, the biggest deer I ever heard was ol\' bushytail swishing around in the leaf litter. \\n\\n\\nIn honor of these raucous rodents, today I present \\"Breakfast\\" by Darrin Bradbury. Darrin\'s a weird dude, to whom I was introduced by another weird dude. I picture his narrator in \\"Breakfast\\" as disengaged and middle aged, inhabiting a perfunctory marriage built on inertia. He\'s either gone offline or never got activated, and I\'m inclined to believe the former. \\n\\n\\nAt first pass I latched on to the one-liners that he drops in each verse, imaginative anthropomorphizations and grandiose elevations of junk mail and mug stains. His details are very John Prine, straddling the laugh/cry line. \\n\\n\\n  Then the skim milk pours down all over Cerealtown\\n  For I am the God of Cerealtown\\n\\n\\nis excellent, though \\n\\n\\n  The telephone rings, though it doesn\'t really ring\\n  These days it\'s just a figure of speech\\n  It beeps and if flashes and it sonically harasses\\n  All the thoughts I\'d really like to keep\\n\\n\\ngives it a run (or a meandering walk, for our narrator) for its money. Let\'s hold some space for his sonically harassed thoughts. \\n\\n\\nEntertaining as the track is, when you gather the scattered bits of ennui they coalesce around death: of Juliet, of God\'s oat children, of private thoughts and of being ok, which he clearly hasn\'t been for a while. It took a few listens for me to convince myself, but I believe our narrator is childless by an untimely exit. His partner\'s still around (see the \\"we\\" in refinance) and death by hawk or drowning strike a violent, gone too soon chord. He\'s hollowed out and stripped for parts, and all that\'s left is a pocket of gray matter in charge of observing the unjust. Equally damning? Skim milk. Who among us with a love of life willingly drinks skim milk? \\n\\n\\nDid Darrin intend to write a grieving parent song? Probably not. No matter. He\'s a man accosted and unclusted, up some junk mail and down a squirrel. If you love him don\'t call him; send him a postcard. \\n\\n\\n\u2013Jack","artistWiki":"https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=1684551","albumWiki":"","relatedArtists":{"album":[],"other":[]}},{"number":212,"song":"Everybody\'s Missing The Sun","artist":"The Gourds","album":"Shinebox","spotifyLink":"https://open.spotify.com/track/6j9ZLPjBGBEn1M6UGjEnLa","textBody":"12-7-2024: Everybody\u2019s Missing the Sun\\n\\n\\n_______________________________\\n\\n\\nSong #212: \\"Everybody\'s Missing the Sun\\"\\nWho Made it: The Gourds\\nYear: 2001\\n_______________________________\\n\\n\\nThoughts: Late start today.

We heard \\"Four Roses Whiskey\\" (F&L #109) from The Galoots back in August. We bumped them over one-hundred monthly listeners and put Laramie on their list of top cities.\\n\\n\\nSince then, they\'ve fallen back to eighty \u2014 time for a boost.\\n_______________________________\\n\\n\\nSong #213: \\"Fallin\' Faster\\" *\\nWho Made it: The Galoots\\nYear: 1996\\n_______________________________\\n\\n\\nThoughts: It makes me happy to put this one out there. It\'s been a six-year favorite. Since it\'ll probably be our last from The Galoots, I\'ll link to their video for \\"Heaven Hill\'s on Fire\\" (not on Spotify), which doubles as a retrospective slideshow.\\n\\n\\nTheir Facebook page has a poignant little exchange in the comments of their last post. It ought to speak to any \\"back-in-the-day\\"-ers on the list:\\n\\n\\n Galoots_FB.png \\n\\n\\n***********************************************\\n\\n\\n\\"Fallin\' Faster\\" is almost the closer on Ham Days.** To me, though, \\"Faster\\" is an opener. There\'s a memory reason that I\'ll get to later (not today), and there\'s the sound. You can hear the motion in the first strum, hitting the strings in series. It reminds me of \\"Like a Rolling Stone\\" and its starting-gun drum hit, which I pointed out earlier as a perfect needle-drop moment.\\n\\n\\nAs you might guess, there aren\'t any lyrics to \\"Faster\\" online. I transcribed them here for anyone who likes to read while they listen.\\n\\n\\nAs you might also guess \u2014 in line with themes from the past few weeks \u2014 it starts with a look, which builds into the chorus:\\n\\n\\nI can\u2019t believe\\nThat you have seen me\\nAnd that I can see myself in you\\nAnd I know I\u2019m fallin\u2019 faster\\nIn love with you\\n\\n\\nNote a difference: the looks in \\"Oh Sarah\\" and \\"ASfY\\" and \\"DTLLTD\\" were mostly communicative, expressing some un-worded feeling. Here, the looks, the seeing, flip around: they\'re taking something/someone in \u2014 when the former type land, these catch them.\\n\\n\\nFor those keeping track, this might be our first conclusive win against Fine-Grained Emotion #2 (Unknowability of Other; Incommunicability of Self) from the midyear review. A pair of loaded looks (given/gotten/felt) bridge the gap. The punch (lines four and five) is hefty.\\n\\n\\nAfter a verbal verse, the chorus comes back with some tweaks:\\n\\n\\nI can\u2019t believe\\nThat you could free me\\nAnd that I could be myself with you\\nAnd you know I\u2019m fallin\u2019 faster\\nIn love with you\\n\\n\\nI\'d weigh this over chorus #1. It\'s a step farther. It hits deeper, too, in my own context. When you\'ve lost some bits you like, it\'s nice to get them back.\\n\\n\\nExample: on F&L #50 (\\"Wayside/Back in Time\\"), Kevin mentioned \\"MattFM\\", which he (eloquently) described as \\"the radio station constantly playing in his head and sometimes falling down into his mouth.\\"\\n\\n\\nThis is true: I like to sing. Folks who\'ve known me know this. When I used to teach, I\'d hum little nonsense songs while I wrote problems on the board. The kids (rascals) caught on and poked fun, which I didn\'t mind.\\n\\n\\nThe problem came in Houston. For most of last year, I didn\'t have much of an outlet. The station kept playing in my head, but it wouldn\'t fall into my mouth. My roommate and I aren\'t on \\"singing\\" terms, and my office-mates deserve peace. Maybe I\'d mumble some phrases on walks around campus or driving to the store, but it wasn\'t quite the same \u2014 missing baseline comfort. The place was too new to let down my guard.\\n\\n\\nThe fix is recent. The mind-to-mouth path is opening up. Bits of nonsense (and sometimes real songs) are falling back down. It\'s a fine thing, and a sign of good times.\\n\\n\\nThese (re)-findings are always surprising \u2014 \'I can\'t believe\' indeed.\\n\\n\\n\u2013Matt\\n\\n\\n* For the real Galoot-heads, check out the alternate version with extended instrumental breaks (live radio recording) on YouTube.\\n\\n\\n** \\"Jfk\\" comes after it, but \\"Jfk\\" sounds like a bonus track.","artistWiki":"https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=31543982","albumWiki":"https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=77356483","relatedArtists":{"album":[],"other":[]}},{"number":214,"song":"Over the Red Cedar","artist":"Charlie Parr","album":"Stumpjumper","spotifyLink":"https://open.spotify.com/track/5xFh8P6jYPwLj2kCfxbmbJ","textBody":"12-9-2024: Over the Red Cedar\\n\\n\\n_______________________________\\n\\n\\nSong #214: \\"Over the Red Cedar\\"\\nWho Made it: Charlie Parr\\nYear: 2015\\n_______________________________\\n\\n\\nThoughts: \\"Cedar\\" has great guitar.

That\'s too bad. I hope today\'s entry will make up for lost time, since we all deserve some warmth.\\n\\n\\nBefore you read the rest, try this video of Chris Thile (of Nickel Creek) and Aoife O\'Donovan (of Kevin\'s reply-all on F&L #27) doing a cover. Thile doesn\'t bust out his full virtuosity, but the friendliness and cheer make up for any lack of shredding.*\\n\\n\\nRecall from previous emails that Trace was the first Son Volt album (so the first from Farrar post Tupelo split). It\'s also their biggest hit. To quote Thile, \\"Trace . . . was kinda one of the things that built that alt-country swell up to a fever.\\"\\n\\n\\nRight after I moved to Houston (August \'23), Volt played a show at the Heights Theater (my favorite spot) that included a full play-through of Trace. I regret not catching it. At that point, I wouldn\'t go far enough.\\n\\n\\nAs certified e-mail users, I\'m sure you\'ve all sent \\"best wishes\\" / \\"best regards\\" (or, more likely, just \\"best\\") in the recent past. When you see that, do you ever wonder what the \\"best wishes\\" are?\\n\\n\\nTo me, this is one of them:\\n\\n\\nMay the wind take your troubles away\\nMay the wind take your troubles away\\nBoth feet on the floor, two hands on the wheel\\nMay the wind take your troubles away\\n\\n\\nSay that more often. If someone wished my troubles away with the wind, it would mean more than any canned \\"best\\". \\n\\n\\nContrast with yesterday: the comfort here is more personal and palatable. Philosophical detachment and respect for time\'s flow aren\'t bad notions, but they\'re cold tools. Odds are, when troubles find a friend, they\'d prefer plain speech. Tell them what\'s true: that we hope for pain to move on and to leave good folks alone. That\'s what warms the heart.\\n\\n\\nClosing thought: internalize the bridge lines.\\n\\n\\nYou never feel alone\\nYou\'re really not alone\\n\\n\\nThe first one isn\'t true, but it ought to be. The second one is true, but it feels like a lie. Believe the second and the first might follow.\\n\\n\\nSee chorus,\\n\\n\\n\u2013Matt\\n\\n\\n*For balance, I\'ll link to Thile covering \\"Radio Cure\\", which is one of my favorites from Wilco. The video is an early-Covid** artifact: I remember watching it a bunch of times while stewing over quarantine-snipped connections.\\n\\n\\n**On the topic of musical artifacts, The Ghost of Paul Revere made a \\"fan compilation video\\" for their song \\"Little Bird\\" around the same time.

Fellow part-time Texan Daniel Johnston put it well in \\"True Love Will Find You in the End\\":\\n\\n\\nThis is a promise with a catch\\nOnly if you\'re looking can it find you\\n\'Cause true love is searching too\\nBut how can it recognize you\\nUnless you step out into the light, the light\\n\\n\\nThings being the way they are, Wilco has a cover.\\n\\n\\nTo branch a different way, go with \'I don\'t need to do a thing\'.

I couldn\'t tell you why it hasn\'t gotten more attention \u2014 maybe the pan flute turns folks off, or maybe it\'s too low-down. Whatever the reason, disregard it. \\"Come Tomorrow\\" is as fine a track as any, and better than more than most.*\\n\\n\\nLyrically, it\'s less opaque than some of the Van Zandt songs we\'ve heard before. The packaging helps: three clean verses, with a quasi-chorus (i.e. repeated line) at the end of each. Verse one (a pre-bass prelude) drops us into some heavy contemplation:\\n\\n\\nCould it be the seasons changin\'\\nThe winds of winter rearrangin\'\\nAll the leaves like fallen queens of sorrow\\nCould be the freezing rain a-fallin\'\\nCould be sad September callin\'\\nOr maybe it\'s the knowin\' she\'ll be gone\\nCome tomorrow\\n\\n\\nThere\'s twofold misdirection. The first lines quiz some cause, but omit the effect. He\'s circling around something, some ruffled feathers. He\'s also playing dumb: he knows full well what \'it\' is, but won\'t put it down without a few herrings. We muse on seasons and winds, leaves and rain, then get to what we\'d rather avoid: a hard goodbye, tomorrow\'s ache.\\n\\n\\n\\"Tomorrow\\", as a word and notion, has gotten more frequent in these letters as we\'ve gone on. The first \\"tomorrow\\" song was \\"Gone Tomorrow\\" (F&L #100). The first \\"tomorrow\\" lyric (\'Will you still see me tomorrow? No, I got too much to do.\') was in \\"Far From Me\\" (F&L #155). Recently, there\'s been a spate of significant tomorrows: \\"A Song for You\\" (\'And tomorrow, we may still be there\') and \\"Don\'t This Look Like the Dark\\" (\'I used to think that tomorrow was just out there waiting for me\') previously, and now today\'s song. The stats line up with the shift (observed in the midyear review) from a largely backward facing, reflective project toward something more interested in what\'s down the line.\\n\\n\\nI started this one early enough that most of today felt like \\"tomorrow\\". Something woke me up at 4:30 (could be ____, could be ______ ) and kept me too wired to get back to sleep. I grabbed my headphones and got down to business. The early hours added perspective to the second verse:\\n\\n\\nWell it\'s strange how many tortured mornings\\nFell upon us with no warning\\nLookin\' for a smile to beg or borrow**\\nIt\'s over now, there\'s no returnin\'\\nA thousand bridges sadly burnin\'\\nWill light the way I\'ll have to walk alone***\\nCome tomorrow\\n\\n\\nThe \\"burning bridges\\" bit might be our metaphor-of-the-year. The charitable reading would say something about \\"learning from mistakes\\", using the light to \\"move forward\\". If you\'re feeling more bitter, the walk puts shame on display. Either way, you should ask: what\'s worth wrecking for the sake of clarity? When is it harmony; when is it truth?\\n\\n\\nWell I guess that no amount of lyin\'\\nTo myself will stop the cryin\'\\nI guess I have to take things like they are\\nThe facts are plain to see, it\'s only\\nThat I ain\'t used to being lonely\\nLike I\'m gonna be without you\\nCome tomorrow\\n\\n\\nIf you go back to the TVZ clip I shared a few weeks back with \\"DTLLTD\\" (F&L #205), you\'ll hear him say that he writes some \'hopeless\' songs. Is \\"Tomorrow\\" hopeless?^ On the one hand, there\'s posturing toward sad acceptance, but the phrasing holds it back from totality. If you start with \'I guess\' and backtrack through \'it\'s only\', you leave some doubt on \\"plain facts\\" \u2014 some \\"maybe\\" wiggles through.\\n\\n\\nThis could be kindness. Take \'sad September\' and \'tomorrow\' to be whatever past and future fit your timeline, sandwiched around some happy middle. When you\'ve been up high, living exalted, it hurts to give it up. It hurts worse to convince yourself that it\'s right and proper, that lowness is the high-road. Put another way: when you\'re staring down a tough stretch, you\'d hate to hack it bare. Proper or not, you keep something for yourself. That\'s what I hear in \'I guess\' and \'it\'s only\': little holdouts, little hopes \u2014 just enough to make it through winter.\\n\\n\\nNot for the last time, we cite \\"Crowbar\\" and the pale/synthetic. We take it pretty far. Not lying, per se, but admitting some ignorant faith \u2014 who\'s to say for sure? Per next year\'s big Halloween costume, \\"Tomorrow is a Long Time\\". \\nYou won\'t get there soon.\\n\\n\\n\u2013Matt\\n\\n\\n*Parentheses here go \\"better than (more than (most))\\" not \\"(better than (more)) than (most)\\".\\n\\n\\n**\'Smile to beg or borrow\' raises a question.

Dive into Adams\u2019 full history of being a slimeball (and the general tumult of Whiskeytown\u2019s ~7 year run) at your own peril. \\n\\n\\nFor the purposes of this F&L, however, I\u2019m going to feign ignorance of such matters and just focus on the music. Why, you ask? For the same reason that the Lead Author still secretly listens to TLoP* \u2014 because some music is too damn good to boycott.\\n\\n\\n\u201c16 Days\u201d is one such song. In fact, the entirety of the song\u2019s host album (Strangers Almanac) falls under this category. It\u2019s an incredibly good album. Among many bangers (\u201cInn Town,\u201d \u201cExcuse Me While I Break My Own Heart Tonight,\u201d \u201cEverything I Do,\u201d \u201cDancing With The Women At The Bar,\u201d etc.), \u201c16 Days\u201d stands out as my favorite. It\u2019s just as good on a sunny Saturday morning dirt road as it is on a lonely Wednesday evening at the bar. You can pick and choose what resonates with you during any given listen. Versatility.\\n\\n\\nTake the period from 3:00 onward, for example. I reckon it\u2019s damn near impossible to resist a raucous headbang/steering wheel percussion session. Give it a try.\\n\\n\\nBut the sound cloaks brutality. Give \u201c16 Days\u201d another spin and hone in on the lyrics. There\u2019s enough subtlety in them that I expect we can all relate in some way. There\u2019s also enough subtlety for me to know that it would be folly to try unpacking them. Regardless of interpretation, there\u2019s no denying the song\u2019s pain. Perhaps it\u2019s best to acknowledge that the lyrics will be there when we need them and until then we can just appreciate a good song.

He has a great website.** This would\'ve been a cool connection on its own, but it\'s got extra heft after watching I Am Trying to Break Your Heart this weekend (a rock-doc about the recording of Yankee Hotel Foxtrot).\\nHere\'s a screen-grab from the documentary: Jeff with Spencer (probably about six years old) at a truckstop Wendy\'s, the older consoling the younger after a rigged claw machine stole his quarter.\\n\\n\\n Tweedy_Wendy\'s.png \\n\\n\\nThe best scene*** in the movie is a little later on the tour bus.

Pollywog-ish.\\n\\n\\n*******************************************\\n\\n\\nContext established, we\'ll get to the song. On \\"Fire\\", again, there\'s the Waxa-knack (Knacksa-hatchee?) for nailing how \\"it\\" feels. Raise your hand (privately) if you\'ve ever demanded a win, gotten it, then turned right back for more. If so, don\'t feel bad. It\'s a case of building momentum, where push begets push. More good in, more good out.

We\'re worse for the loss.\\n\\n\\nAnother loss: the echoing, whip-crack snare hit (post \'lie-la-lie\') from the original \\"Boxer\\" is gone on Harris\' take.

It\u2019s a place from which to watch the world go by, not as an observer but as a participant. To watch the sun go down, to feel the changing seasons. A place to drink a beverage (coffee, beer, pink lemonade, etc.) and contemplate. A place to watch squirrels (F&Ls 211 & 223) and listen to the crickets. It\u2019s a place to live and laugh, to lust and love.\\n\\n\\nREK tells us about the porch he shared with Lyle Lovett, who co-wrote this and released his own version, while sort of attending Texas A&M.

I\'ve said before that she makes good music for napping. That\'s not a dig. Many a slow afternoon, I\'ve queued up a couple of her albums, sprawled on the couch, and drifted in and out. Summer \'21 was ideal: I had the upper level of a bunkhouse to myself, a couch just short of long enough, and windows to carry a breeze.\\n\\n\\nWhen I say \\"nap\\", I mean a particular type. A Welch nap isn\'t a clock-out. You shouldn\'t drift off, get some rest, then wake up and go on with your day. That\'s improper. There should be more back-and-forth. Make yourself comfortable and plan to hear it all. No distractions. The right mindset is loose and receptive, edging toward meditative.\\n\\n\\nThe goal is to listen like you\'re dreaming, like the song forms in your head. Lose focus; regain it; then lose it again. It\'s easier with Welch than with most acts. She toes the line between down-home modesty and scriptural grandeur, familiar and odd.* A good Welch song (like today\'s) makes a drive into Corning sound like a pilgrimage.\\n\\n\\nYou should \\"wake-up\\" a little unsettled.\\n_______________________________\\n\\n\\nSong #227: \\"Revelator\\"\\nWho Made it: Gillian Welch\\nYear: 2001\\n_______________________________\\n\\n\\nThoughts: Time (The Revelator) is the album for a knockout Welch nap. \\"Revelator\\" opens. The first notes (played by Rawlings) remind me of a hypnotist\'s cue, like fingers snapping or a gong ringing. They get your attention. Once you\'re onboard, Welch lays the foundation:\\n\\n\\nDarling, remember\\nWhen you come to me\\nI\'m the pretender\\nAnd not what I\'m supposed to be\\n\\n\\nFor the sake of focus, I won\'t even touch the other verses.** There\'s plenty happening here. Right off the bat, she expects (or invites) whoever\'s listening to listen a certain way. It\'s a mark of pride and intention, partially, and partially a disclaimer. She admits fallibility. If there\'s some fuzziness and contradiction in what she has to say, or in what she seems to be, it\'s honest and human \u2014\\"understand and accept that I may not know myself\\".\\n\\n\\nThe lines could be trying to temper the \\"next-big-thing\\"-isms that were cropping up when Welch was writing and recording Time. The year before, her work on O Brother, Where Art Thou? led to a hugely successful, Grammy winning soundtrack, so I\'d expect she felt some pressure. Even the semi-prophetic greats aren\'t immune to imposter-syndrome.\\n\\n\\nI spent a lot of time this morning working over the last line. It\'s a big fear: not being what you\'re supposed to be. To try and allay it, think about the statement \\"I am what I\'m supposed to be\\". How can it fail to be true? I\'ll rope in some calculus for scaffolding. At some point, you probably learned this:\\n ContDef.png \\n\\n\\nSaying \\"f is continuous at a\\" sounds like one condition, but to unpack the definition (in the style of AP calc), three things need to be true:\\n\\n\\n ContConditions.png \\n\\n\\nAny of those conditions could fail. If all you know is that \\"f is not continuous at a\\", you can\'t tell (a priori) which condition is missing. The assumptions matter.\\n\\n\\nApply the same setup to \\"I am what I\'m supposed to be\\". If that\'s true, it means...\\n* \\"What I am\\" exists (i.e. you are something well-defined)\\n* \\"What I\'m supposed to be\\" exists (i.e. there is something that you should be)\\n* Those two things are the same\\nAgain, depending on your perspective, any of those conditions might fail. Most of the fear in \\"not being what you\'re supposed to be\\" probably comes from assuming that the first two conditions are automatic, and that missing the third is a failure. Accepting some looseness in the first two conditions deflates the \\"wrongness\\" of any imagined mismatch. You can\'t \\"fall short\\" of something that doesn\'t exist. Things to be and things to should be take time to form, and time after that to be revealed. In the meantime, doing \u2014 acting, reflecting, reacting \u2014 matters more.\\n\\n\\nIn my reckoning, listening to Gillian counts as doing.\\n\\n\\n\u2013Matt\\nPS: It didn\'t fit anywhere above, but I wanted to link this performance of \\"Revelator\\" from 2004. You can hear Welch drop one of the softest F-bombs on musical record^ while staring down the camera. It also highlights Rawlings\' contributions, which I\'ve maybe undersold. His solo at the end is worth every shake.\\n\\n\\nIn that same video, there\'s an ensemble performance of \\"The Weight\\" with Old Crow Medicine Show. There\'s also a great line in \\"Elvis Presley Blues\\"  \u2014 I\'m itchin\' like a man on a fuzzy tree  \u2014 that\'s not in the studio version.\\n\\n\\nPPS: I received some complaints about shifting font sizes in these emails.

My mom and dad and I made many requests, until our picks had pushed his too far down the queue to have any hope of playing. He complained about this, but kept taking requests. That\'s his nature.\\n\\n\\n********************************\\n\\n\\nVan Zandt on \\"Raton\\" is nine years older than on any song we\'ve heard so far.* You can hear some age in his voice, drying out the edges. His preferred themes remain much the same, including dreams ( \xe0 la \\"Columbine\\") and \'laughing eyes\' ( \xe0 la \\"Loretta\\"):\\n\\n\\nShall I cast my dreams upon your love, babe\\nAnd lie beneath the laughter of your eyes?\\n\\n\\nI think that \'cast\' here is an interesting verb. The first thing that comes to mind, for me, is throwing something down, like a bottle in the street. It\'s not a loving image: hard surfaces, shattered dreams, regret, et cetera. Slightly better would be \\"to cast\\" in the sense of fishing (no hard surfaces, less chance of breakage), which still entails separating yourself from your dreams \u2014 not the best either.\\n\\n\\nThe \\"casting\\" that I like best here is the kind you do in knitting. To start a knit piece, you need to cast on, i.e. to take the loose yarn and make a row of stitches on the needle. It\'s the first step in turning the basic material (full of potential, but not yet special) into something fine: a sweater, a blanket, a scarf.\\n\\n\\nThat\'s a nice way to think about dreams and love. Before \\"casting\\", you can\'t tell how the dreams will fit together, or if they even can. There might be a vision (a template, a pattern), but going at it with bare hands will make a mess of tangles. When you cast upon love, the dreamy yarn gets something to grab. There\'s an organizing principle. The piece isn\'t done, but the yarn can stop getting in its own way. It has a place to build.\\n\\n\\nThis goes back to the Avett Brothers line (cited with \\"Fire\\") that I think is wonderful: \'I will rearrange my plans and change for you\'. Note that \\"rearrange\\" is not \\"sacrifice\\", and yarn in a sweater is still yarn. I don\'t hear the line as a favor, either. Having a reason and a way to rearrange your dreams/plans is a good thing. Taking the windblown, bounced-around path gives you lots of yarn. At some point, you ought to make something with it \u2014 cast and get to knittin\'.\\n\\n\\nThe other part (lying beneath the laughter of your eyes) gets away with less unpacking. Picture your favorite eyes, hear the laugh, and the line\'ll do its job.\\n\\n\\n********************************\\n\\n\\nI\'ll keep it short (time for bed), but I can\'t sign off without quoting this bit:\\n\\n\\nWell you cannot count the miles until you feel them\\nAnd you cannot hold a lover that is gone\\n\\n\\nW.r.t. the miles: hard won, hard lost. Something that comes too easy (arrives unfelt) will probably leave the same way. Labor makes it stick.\\n\\n\\nW.r.t. the lover: this is true, painful, and part of the road.\\n\\n\\n\u2013Matt\\n\\n\\n*The album art for At My Window nods back to Townes Van Zandt.

Sorry for that. You can still play it until the epiphany if you\'re fussy about seasons, or you can make the right choice and play it year round. The dobro is pretty special.\\n\\n\\nDespite the name, neither \\"Christmas\\" nor \\"prison\\" are Prine\'s main concerns. With the usual focus of a man in love, he drops both after the first few lines and pivots to her:\\n\\n\\nAnd I dream of her always\\nEven when I don\'t dream\\nHer name\'s on my tongue\\nAnd her blood\'s in my stream\\n\\n\\nThe song sounds like a letter, where the early bits (turkey, pistols) are just niceties to pad the front-end before he gets to the meat. He could have \\"intended\\" to really talk about Christmas in prison, then drifted off topic to something more magnetic. That\'s the sense that the dream, name, and blood lines give: that all roads lead to his well-beloved \\"Rome\\".\\n\\n\\nIt\'s single-minded writing of a single-minded feeling. When you listen to the chorus, pay attention to how he sings \'awhile\':\\n\\n\\nWait awhile eternity\\nOld mother nature\'s got nothing on me\\nCome to me, run to me, come to me now\\nWe\'re rolling, my sweetheart\\nWe\'re flowing, by God\\n\\n\\nIt\'s well-established* that Prine\'s homely voice is part of his appeal. He can make a beautiful moment, but he has to work for it. I heard it on \\"Far From Me\\" (F&L #155) in \'angels sing\', and I hear it on \\"Prison\\" in \'awhile\'. While the Grobans of the world dish out shimmering high-notes for a dime a dozen, Prine saves his for the moments that matter.\\n\\n\\nContrast the confident chorus with the simple last verse:\\n\\n\\nIt\'s Christmas in prison\\nThere\'ll be music tonight\\nI\'ll probably get homesick**\\nI love you\\nGoodnight***\\n\\n\\nThere\'s some fuzziness in the timeline. In the first verse, it was Christmas; in the last, it is Christmas. The addressee is also ambiguous: is the \'her\' in the first verse the \'you\' in the last? If we stick to \\"writing letters\\", here\'s what I think: \\n* The last verse is the first draft. It\'s intended for the \'her\' in the first verse. His situation is low, but he knows how he feels. This draft might not get sent (see the walls in \\"No Ordinary Blue\\").\\n* The first verse is the last draft. Either it\'s just the first four lines (up through \'wood\') and goes to \'her\' (making the other lines internal reflection), or it\'s the whole thing and goes to a confidant. Both options back off somehow, whether in content or delivery.\\nMaybe it\'s not worth dissecting. The last verse tells the story. \\n\\n\\nJP re-recorded the song for Souvenirs, where it feels a little different.^\\n\\n\\n\u2013Matt\\n\\n\\n*Prine\'s obituary in The Guardian describes his voice as \\"a rough, artless, nasal rasp that Dylan suggested sounded as if Prine had swallowed a jew\u2019s harp\\". I think that\'s too harsh, but it gets the point across.\\n\\n\\n**Does it change if you\'re home?\\n\\n\\n***Perfect rhythm in these last three lines.\\n\\n\\n^As in further toward eternity.","artistWiki":"https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=292822","albumWiki":"https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=13745510","relatedArtists":{"album":["John Prine","Steve Goodman","Ralph MacDonald","Grady Martin","Bobby Wood","Kenny Ascher","Steve Burgh","Johnny Christopher","Cissy Houston","Judy Clay","Doyle Grisham","Leo LeBlanc","Mike Leech","Raun MacKinnon","Kenny Malone","Hugh McDonald","Steve Mosley","Dave Prine","Jerry Shook","William Slater","Deirdre Tuck Corley","Reggie Young","David Briggs","Arif Mardin","Ira Friedlander","Wendie Lombardi"],"other":["John Prine","Steve Goodman"]}},{"number":231,"song":"You Ain\'t Goin\' Nowhere","artist":"The Byrds","album":"Sweetheart Of The Rodeo","spotifyLink":"https://open.spotify.com/track/6kPxXhjSvy8RsmZBAJUiFs","textBody":"12-26-2024: You Ain\u2019t Goin\u2019 Nowhere\\n\\n\\nBrief addendum to yesterday: \\"CiP\\" got stuck in my head overnight, and I woke up with new ideas.

I couldn\'t find any live recordings or alternates on YouTube, so there\'ll be no cross-referencing of versions.\\n\\n\\nThe first line speaks to my soul:\\n\\n\\nWhat does he see in those mashed potatoes?*\\nWhat secrets does he hold that can be so grim?\\nThe silence like a canyon dividing them\\nHe\'s on one side she\'s opposite him\\nTrying so desperately to get his attention\\n\\n\\nGood choice of setting. The dinner table is a prime location for fraught conversation and quotidian drama.** You get the sense that the canyon\'s been growing, that the silence weighs heavy, and that one more missed signal could tank the whole affair. Whether he\'s clammed up over \'grim secrets\' or just wandering in his mind, it\'s time to remember who\'s with him.\\n\\n\\nThankfully, a B-bomb breaks through:\\n\\n\\nShe says, \\"Honey, you\'re a bastard of great proportion.\\"\\nHe says, \\"Darling, I plead guilty to that sin.\\"\\nWith potatoes halfway to his mouth\\nHe looks her in the eye and says, \\"Without a doubt,\\nMy love for you is all that I believe in.\\"\\n\\n\\nThat\'s some dialogue. \'Bastard of great proportion\' rocks. Kudos to she for taking the reins, and to he for sticking the landing.***\\n\\n\\nIf you read the chorus lyrics on Spotify, they\'ll tell you that \'her heart is sent soaring.\' I\'m not sure that\'s right. It might be a trick of the Canadian accent, but I hear it as \'her heart isn\'t sorry,\' which I prefer. \\"Lifting of sorriness\\" is a more tangible feeling (I think) than \\"soaring\\", and relates more directly to the quiet anxiety of the preceding verse.\\n\\n\\nEither way, the point comes across: words are strong. That\'s not a wholly new notion for us (#s 34, 47, 48, 61, 78, 142, 188, 210, 215), but this time it\'s broader.

If you\'d rather stay a little confused and let it wash over you, you won\'t be straying too far from the goal. Here\'s what Case had to say about \\"cryptic lyrics\\":\\nPitchfork: I\'ll be honest, I\'m often confused by your lyrics. Do you go out of your way to make things cryptic?\\nNeko Case: You\'re not supposed to totally know what\'s happening. The songs are supposed to give you clues so you can fill in the blanks. I don\'t know if I\'m good at this or not, but I try. I started out trying to write songs that were more straightforward but it didn\'t really work. And I\'m particularly not good at writing love songs. Maybe if something comes to be, but I can\'t just whip one up. Unless it\'s about loving dogs, then I\'ll sound like a kook. Maybe I do now.\\nWhat I like most about the lyrics to \\"Star Witness\\" is that they\'re mostly nouns. Evocative nouns.\\nTrees break the sidewalk\\nAnd the sidewalk skins my knees\\nThere\'s glass in my thermos and blood on my jeans\\nNickels and dimes of the Fourth of July\\nRoll off in a crooked line\\nTo the chain-link lots where the red tails dive\\nOh, how I forgot what it\'s like**\\nI\'d make it a rule of thumb that nouns evoke more when they have dates attached to them (like a \'Falcon sedan, 1969\') or show up in odd places (like \'glass in my thermos\').\\nSpeaking of \\"nouns in odd places\\", I\'ll leave you with this picture, which some YouTuber used as a thumbnail for \\"Star Witness\\".\\n\\n\\n NC_Deer.jpg \\n\\n\\nAlways a little spooky.\\n\\n\\n\u2013Matt\\n\\n\\nPS: For something really special, listen to how Caase and her band handle the outro in this performance.

I\'ll keep floating them out.\\n\\n\\nAs it happens, I had an Allen encounter in the wild a couple days ago \u2014 not with Terry himself, but with a (sort-of) fan of his art. I was walking through DIA and overheard one flight attendant ask another if they \\"had seen the gargoyles in baggage claim?\\"\\n\\n\\n TA_Gargs.jpg \\n\\n\\nThe gargoyles (titled \\"Notre Denver\\") are Allen sculptures. Previously (F&L #148), I talked about \\"Countree Music\\", which is his big tree sculpture at IAH. It\'s nice that there\'s an Allen installment on both sides of my flight home.\\n\\n\\nToday\'s track is from Juarez. Even more so than Lubbock (on everything), Juarez is an album album. It\'s a story (\\"A Simple Story\\"), which is this:\\n\\n\\n Simple_Story.png \\n\\n\\nI took those pictures from the booklet in my deluxe LP reissue.* It has lyrics, essays (including from Dave Hickey of \\"Amarillo Highway\\" and Dave Alvin of The Knitters/X), and pictures of Terry\'s art.\\n\\n\\n TA_Arts.png \\n\\n\\nTo be precise, Juarez is more than an album. Allen calls it \\"a haunting,\\" which includes\\n\\n\\n\\"a series of drawings, texts, and constructions; stacks of notebooks with notations and sketches; two books of writings, poems, water-colors, and photographs (one published); numerous prints; a multitude of songs and recordings; a record album accompanying a suite of lithographs and texts; a screenplay; an NPR radio show; a live one-woman musical theater piece with Jo Harvey Allen; a musical theater work co-written with David Byrne (not produced); and five full-room museum installations with video and sound.\\"\\n\\n\\nLots of work and many years. The first \\"stage\\" of Juarez (the full record and accompanying set of drawings) debuted here in Houston at the Contemporary Arts Museum.\\n\\n\\nYou get the sense that he wants to do everything, and has done most of it. One more quote from the biography, with Terry describing a fumbled attempt by the Smithsonian to acquire rights to his archives:\\n\\n\\n\\"They said, \'We don\'t want anything to do with your music. We only want your art.\' It was like, \'We\'ll take this part of what you do, but this other part of what you do, we disdain.\' It pissed me off, so I told them \'Forget it.\' Art is all about your senses, stupid . . . . You don\'t get up in the morning and say, \'Today I just smell.\' \\"\\n\\n\\nIn the spirit of the quote (but of dubious legality), I\'m attaching a PDF of the booklet accompanying the Juarez LP. Give it a look.\\n_______________________________\\n\\n\\nSong #239: \\"What of Alicia\\"\\nWho Made it: Terry Allen\\nYear: 1975\\n_______________________________\\n\\n\\nThoughts: Repeating the usual disclaimer: you should listen to the whole album if you have time. Singling out \\"Alicia\\" smacks of \\"just smelling\\" or of cutting one finger off a hand and asking it to punch. Still, you\'re busy folks, and a potent something is better than nothing.\\n\\n\\n\\"Alicia\\" is biographical flashback/preemptive eulogy, happening two thirds of the way into Juarez. There are some crude lines, sure, and potentially ill-advised vocables in the outro, but undeniable presence. Something about the canned wind and wonky chords (0:20) holds me tight.\\n\\n\\nOn F&L #11, I mentioned liking the \\"each verse gets an age, young to old\\" structure. Add this to that list. Inevitably, maybe, it makes you think about what you did at the stated age (for those in the past) or might yet do (for those in the future). I can say for sure that Sailor\'s twenty-three wasn\'t much like mine, nor like Mark Hoppus\'s.\\n\\n\\nProbably for the best.\\n\\n\\n\u2013Matt\\n\\n\\nPS: Two video links. Here he is playing \\"Alicia\\" with both his sons in Lubbock (high quality audio), and here he is playing it at a bar that\'s just northwest of my apartment (low quality audio).\\n\\n\\n*I also have the t-shirt.","artistWiki":"https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=1718517","albumWiki":"https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=11533814","relatedArtists":{"album":["Terry Allen","Peter Kaukonen","Greg Douglass"],"other":["Terry Allen"]}},{"number":240,"song":"Don\'t Let Me Come Home A Stranger","artist":"Tim and Mollie O\'Brien","album":"Away Out On The Mountain","spotifyLink":"https://open.spotify.com/track/6lLP7N1LOEsVpkBkvxhlS4","textBody":"1-4-2025: Don\u2019t Let Me Come Home A Stranger\\n\\n\\nYouTube roundup before we get into it:\\n* Sturg ripping \\"The Promise\\" on a strat (here).\\n* Sad Thile breaking out some Elliot Smith (here).\\n\\"Two\\" counts as a roundup.\\n_______________________________\\n\\n\\nSong #240: \\"Don\'t Let Me Come Home A Stranger\\"\\nWho Made it: Tim and Mollie O\'Brien *\\nYear: 2006\\n_______________________________\\n\\n\\nThoughts: Be forewarned: gonna be a moody one. When I mentioned a \\"wistful tune-of-return\\" on #225, this is what I meant. The mood wasn\'t right then, but I\'ll give it a go now.\\nTangentially and semi-directly, we\'ve heard from T&M O\'Brien before. Tim played with Darrell Scott on \\"Long Time Gone\\" (#114), played backup on the Stu-grass records, and co-wrote \\"When You Come Back Down\\". Kevin mentioned that Tim and Mollie do a version of Gillian\'s \\"Wichita\\" (#149) and \\"Orphan Girl\\". Today\'s song is also a cover; Robin and Linda Williams** did the original.\\n\\n\\nYet another track from the fabled \\"Uncle Joe Christmas Mixtape\\".*** I was lukewarm on it (understandably) until I went off to college. When I came home (yes) on my first winter break, I commandeered the CD and put it in the ol\' Honda Insight. \\n\\n\\n\\"Stranger\\" didn\'t come on until late-ish one night when I was sitting in the driveway. Mind you, December \'16 was the closest I\'ve been to \\"original home\\" (connection-wise) in the past eight years \u2014 I\'d only been gone for ten weeks. Still, the lyrics (and their premonitions) laid me out flat:\\n\\n\\nWill there come a time when the memories fade?\\nAnd pass on with the long, long years?\\nWhen the ties no longer bind?\\nLord save me from this darkest fear.\\nDon\'t let me come home a stranger,\\nI couldn\'t stand to be a stranger.\\n\\n\\nI\'ve been stranger-ized thrice over since then. There\'s still some welcome wherever I\'ve been, but it\'s never what it was. Celebration cedes to recognition; recognition cedes to strangeness. Nothing profound or personally specific in that. It\'s just a numbers game. To quote Lenderman\'s \\"Knockin\' \\":\\n\\n\\nLoneliness is simple\\nNot much else is\\n\\n\\nSimple still hurts. We\'d like to not be subject to cycles. We\'d like to forgo the exhaust stage (out with the old) and keep the intake (in with the new). \\n\\n\\nWould that we could without blowing the engine.\\n\\n\\nThat\'s not to say that \\"intake\\" is pleasant either. What say the O\'Briens w.r.t. the frontier?\\n\\n\\nIn this place so far from home\\nThey know my name but they don\'t know me\\nThey hear my voice, they see my face\\nBut they can lay no claim on me\\n\\n\\nThat verse stings. On bad days in new towns, that\'s about how I\'ve felt \u2014 like a tolerated visitor, but by no means a part of the team. As often noted, being around (a.o.t. with) a crowd doesn\'t help. The Burritos put it well:\\n\\n\\nDo you know how it feels to be lonesome?\\nWhen there\'s just no one left who really cares.\\nDid you ever try to smile at some people?\\nAnd all they ever seem to do is stare?\\n\\n\\nThat\'s from \\"Do You Know How It Feels\\".^ It\'s not sustainable, but it has to be endurable for a while.

I don\'t think I\'ve mentioned the story before, but my turntable came from the basement of The Rock \u2014 a truly scary place. Someone (Ben S?) found it with some dusty old records and brought it up to the ground floor. It wasn\'t in working condition, so I made it my project to fix it and acquire a minimal working setup.\\n\\n\\nIt was fun: sort of a small-scale ZAMM endeavor. I cleaned off the gunk, put a new belt on it, greased the spindle, and hooked it through a little pre-amp to some cheap-(ish) powered speakers. That setup served me/Kevin D well from summer \'18 til now.\\n\\n\\nI live pretty frugally (lots of rice and beans), but I got it in my head last month that the rig could use an upgrade.

It\'s like a song that speaks to itself \u2014 a mantra. Wanting \\"now and forever\\" to be \\"here and now\\" clashes with knowing that it almost always isn\'t.

I cross Fannin Street* on my way to the park.\\n_______________________________\\n\\n\\nSong #248: \\"Dublin Blues\\"\\nWho Made it: Guy Clark\\nYear: 1995\\n_______________________________\\n\\n\\nThoughts: First, a potential misunderstanding: in the opening line, it\'s \'the Chili Parlor bar\', not \'a chilly parlor bar\'. I\'ll admit that I\'d been hearing it wrong until I paid attention \u2014 I thought he meant that bars in Austin keep the AC too high. Instead, he\'s singing about a specific place: the Texas Chili Parlor (still open) was a haunt for Clark and like-minded friends (collectively, \\"Mad Dogs\\") back in his younger days. On Google maps, you can see the state capitol poking out behind it.\\n TCP.png \\n\\n\\nI attached a Texas Monthly article (pdf) that talks more about it. Here\'s Clark explaining the origin of his yearn-worthy margaritas:\\n\\n\\n\u201cEveryone was hanging out at the Chili Parlor, and they started ordering margaritas made with mezcal, which is just horrible,\u201d Clark remembered. \u201cThe only reason it came about was because nobody had any money, and it was cheap. That was a Mad Dog margarita.\u201d \\n\\n\\nNow that I know, I\'ll have to go and try one.\\n\\n\\n*************************\\n\\n\\nStoried bars aside, you can hear the time behind \\"Dublin\\". Clark\'s twenty years older here than he was on Old No. 1 \u2014 about halfway between debut and death. His voice wasn\'t \\"clean\\" to begin with, but two decades of booze and cigs put extra gravel in the \'mm-hmm\'s.\\n\\n\\nLike his protege Steve Earle, grunts and coughs are part of Clark\'s vocal palette. They\'re necessary, probably, to keep the pipes unblocked, and they\'re packed with character. Listen for the \'hmph\' after the first \'goodbye\' when the song settles into his chest. \\n\\n\\nMaybe to balance his gruffness, Clark enlists two phenoms for harmony: Emmylou Harris and Nanci Griffith.** When the three come together (as in the last minute, when the bass really gets going), it drops my jaw \u2014 grand incongruence.\\n\\n\\nWhile we\'re talking \\"balance\\", we ought to tackle the chorus:\\n\\n\\nSo forgive me all my anger, forgive me all my faults\\nThere\'s no need to forgive me for thinking what I thought\\nI loved you from the get go and I\'ll love you till I die\\nI loved you on the Spanish Steps the day you said goodbye\\n\\n\\nThe first line asks some big (maybe impossible?) favors: \'all\', after all, is a lot. Still, I hear contrition more than greed, apology more than demand. And to even the scale, the last lines pledge everything.***\\n\\n\\nMaybe better than most of anyone else, Clark knows how to say I love you.^ He did; he does; he will: I believe him, but not because he repeats it. Instead, the clincher is the context. It\'s built up, bit by bit, until the \\"three little words\\" seem clear \u2014 not understatements, but understated. Because when you get down to it, who could you ask \u2014 who would you ask?  \u2014 to forgive (you) all (your) faults? \\n\\n\\nNot just anyone: we ask the most when they mean the most. This is well past \\"playing it cool\\". An ask like that must be urgent, must be necessary. It\'s something you\'d say on your only road left. Not proud, per se, but honest and brave:\\n\\n\\nI\'ll stand up and be counted\\nI\'ll face up to the truth\\nI\'ll walk away from trouble\\nBut I can\'t walk away from you\\n\\n\\nAs it happens, I had a dream last night about gambling. Maybe that informed my song choice, because \\"Dublin\\" has plenty of \\"skin in the game\\". I\'m thinking back to \\"Oh Sarah\\" (F&L #210) and how \\"the world gets scarier the more you love its folks\\".^^^ \\n\\n\\nI stand by that: with compassion, worries creep in. There\'s some appeal in remaining unhooked, skin sequestered, untouched and untouching. It\'s a slippery, low-stakes lifestyle. Picture simple; picture Lebowski. It shows up in the refrain:\\n\\n\\nI wished I was in Austin in the Chili Parlor Bar\\nDrinking Mad Dog Margaritas and not caring where you are\\n\\n\\nThere must be a lie in there. Ignoring the allure of chili and mezcal, to wish not to care doesn\'t much sound like a man on the line \u2014 his head, sure, but not his gut.\\n\\n\\nAnyhow, a life is made for more than beans. Chew on \\"Dublin\\" for a good long while.\\n\\n\\n\u2013Matt\\n\\n\\nPS1: Lots of covers on this one (Earle, Van Zandt, Mipso...), but my favorite that I\'ve found is Joe Ely playing it in Austin at Clark\'s 70th birthday celebration.^^ He replaces the \'mm-hmm\' after \'Fort Worth\' with \'Oh boy\', which gets a laugh from the crowd.\\n\\n\\nPS2: Unsure whether I have more often been \'too proud to come in out of the rain\' literally or figuratively. My backyard tent days come to mind.\\n\\n\\nPS3: In a nice nod to Dublin, listen for Kenny Malone playing the bodhr\xe1n at the beginning. Sadly, Malone passed away in 2021. Obituary here.\\n\\n\\n*Tom Waits warns against it.\\n\\n\\n**Granted, Harris and Griffith have similar voices, so it\'s a little hard to tell that they\'re both there. Take it as listening practice. I hear the distinction most plainly at 3:43 when Griffith goes high and Harris stays low.\\n\\n\\n***Exercise: compare to #221.\\n\\n\\n^More from him along these lines to come.\\n\\n\\n^^You can see fellow Lubbock-boy Lloyd Maines in the back on mandolin.

It reminds me (very specifically) of Davenport, Iowa. Back in summer 2020, after landing my teaching gig, I made the trek from Laramie to Bath in my brand new (used) RAV-4. Davenport was my overnight at the end of the first day. I had a long playlist going throughout the drive, and \\"Carousel\\" came on the next morning. If you want the full experience, queue it up the next time you find yourself on the Fred Schwengel Memorial Bridge in the pre-dawn Iowan hours.\\n\\n\\nThe name of that playlist is \\"Matt and his cactus cross the country to educate the youths in Maine\\".

I\'m mustering my focus to get something down. It\'s been a drowsy day. I could make coffee, but that\'s not a good habit for this time of night. I\'ll  rely on the Williams magic to get me in the zone.\\n\\n\\nFirst: \'six blocks away\' might work in your run-of-the-mill pedestrian city, but you\'ve got to at least square that to match the Houston scale \u2014 thirty-six should do it. The measure itself can stretch and shrink to fit your means and mobility. To go overboard with metaphor, you could even take it as temporal* separation (or relational, sentimental, etc.). Do what you need to drum up some distance.\\n\\n\\nNow, think about the loneliness of near-adjacency \u2014 the frustration of not-quite convenience. \'Six blocks\' hurts because it\'s close. That\'s how it went when I lived in Bath: Portland, \\"the big city\\" was \'six blocks away\' in the sense of \\"forty-five minutes south on Route 1\\". That\'s far enough that I hardly ever went, and close enough to  feel crummy about it \u2014 an inertial pickle.\\n\\n\\nYou find these things all over. They challenge your itch. Stymied, you sweat. Remember, though, that steps add up.\\n\\n\\nYou should slip on your shoes and start walking. \\n\\n\\n\u2013Matt\\n\\n\\n*On temporal separation: Williams re-recorded all of Sweet Old World in 2017 (25 years after the original).

Last night was awful for sleeping. The kids upstairs were stomping around until the wee hours. That doesn\'t usually bother me \u2014 they do it with no meanness. Since it did bother me last night, I\'ll assume I brought my own meanness into the mix.\\n\\n\\nI got tight in the chest: our tub\'s been dripping, and I started to think it had launched some mold spores. I didn\'t want to hear the kids; I didn\'t want to breathe the dirt. I fell into the sort of tired, ungenerous loop that hasn\'t kept me up much recently but used to frequently. Some outdoor cold exposure would have set me straight, but that\'s a distant luxury. I jammed in new earplugs, queued up \\"Brown Noise/Black Screen 12hrs No Ads\\" on my headphones, put on my eyemask, and pulled the sheet over my face \u2014 full retreat.\\n\\n\\nThat didn\'t work. I\'d just dulled the outers. It was like boiling inside a poncho, soaking with sweat instead of rain. It took a couple hours of \'punching holes in the dark\' to tire myself out.\\n\\n\\nThat\'s why I picked \\"Rogers Park\\" today. It makes me sad, but it\'s good for sitting with rawness. This solo/acoustic is hypnotic.

It\'s a classic Van Zandt number: poetic, evocative, etc. But, at this point, it\'s also well-trodden. I don\'t think I could drum up much new to say beyond what I\'ve already said about home and dreams and wind.* And since TVZ has probably had more pages of praise this year than anyone else, we ought to switch it up\\n\\n\\nSo, it\'ll be a Lenderman night instead. This feels right: can\'t be coincidence that his Tiny Desk dropped exactly at the \\"100 to go\\" point and exactly a week before the Houston show \u2014that\'s kismet, baby. That\'s manifestation.**\\n\\n\\nThe other justification is that \\"Catholic Priest\\" has been hounding me today. I think it\'s the standout from the Desk show (starting at 8:09). You can see the multi-instrumentalist fiddle guy (Xandy Chelmis, per description) grinning and swaying before he comes in, which is always a good sign.\\n\\n\\n Screenshot 2025-01-29 211053.png \\n\\n\\nI\'ve tangentially mentioned my semi-Catholic upbringing. I never wanted to be a priest, but I get the appeal. \\"Catholic Priest\\" makes it sound easy, simple. There\'s a hint of \\"Zip City\\" in the first verse (\'And he makes good money as long as Reynolds wrap keeps everything wrapped up tight\'), which might be deliberate. Our boy is a confirmed Truckers fan.***\\n\\n\\n Screenshot 2025-01-29 213147.png \\n\\n\\nPreliminaries aside, here\'s what I wanted to get to:\\n\\n\\nI wish I remembered what I said\\nI woke up embarrassed with a pain in my head\\nI wish I remembered hurtin\' your feelings\\nI woke up embarrassed, took out the trash\\nI woke up embarrassed\\nAnd I tried to make you laugh\\n\\n\\n\\"When I Drink\\" comes to mind. Anxiety, embarrassment, and foot-in-mouthedness could fill many an email, but I\'m more interested in the midline: \\n\\n\\nI wish I remembered hurtin\' your feelings.\\n\\n\\nThat\'s the part that\'s hounded me. It feels like a counterpoint (adjoint?^) to something I\'ve often wondered: when does it \\"count\\" to be happy?\\n\\n\\nAn example: when I ran high school track, I thought I broke five minutes in the mile. It was at my last meet, senior year, and I came in on the cusp. My coach thought I made it. And when I checked results online, I saw 4:59:33. I floated around, content and proud, until a \\"friend\\" pointed out (days later) that I\'d read the wrong column: the sub-five time was an exaggerated seed. It\'s what my coach said to get me in a fast heat. My actual time was 5:01.\\n\\n\\nThat knocked me down a peg. I didn\'t like it. I tried to convince myself that 4:59 was the \\"real\\" time. I thought I could revert the memory and go back to feeling good, but it never worked.^^ I couldn\'t un-trick myself.\\n\\n\\nWhat\'s that got to do with \\"Priest\\"? Put it next to the hurt feelings. I knew something (the truth) and wished I didn\'t; MJ\'s clerically-curious persona doesn\'t know (doesn\'t remember) and wishes he did. His is the more noble direction, but we both wound up sad.\\n\\n\\nThere\'s another other layer in the head/gut distinction: if he thinks to wish to remember, he must already know (by feeling, or by having been told) that he was in the wrong. What difference, then, would it make to remember? \\n\\n\\nMaybe it comes down to needing a strong foundation \u2014 a steady place to rest your regret. Someone can tell you \'what [you] said\', but they can\'t put you back in the moment. And if you can\'t fish it up, you\'re stuck bemoaning a void, a nothing, a hole with shameful edges. \\n\\n\\nWorse, maybe, would be to lack the edges: to not know to feel guilty, but to suspect it, and to feel it all the same. The less defined the failures, the more they grow their teeth. I\'m thinking \\"hollow\\" and \\"rotten\\" and words like that \u2014 a bad state of affairs.\\n\\n\\n\\"Priest\\" doesn\'t end there, so let\'s not either. Here\'s the good faith:\\n\\n\\nI woke up embarrassed\\nAnd I tried to make you laugh\\n\\n\\nTo wrangle another quote: what else can you say?^^^ What else can you do? A laugh isn\'t an answer, but it\'s got the right spirit. In lieu of a \\"fix\\" \u2014 or ten Hail Marys \u2014 it might be good enough. For what, maybe, is hard to say, but the thought counts for something.\\n\\n\\nIn summary: peace be with you (and also with you).\\n_____________________________\\n\\n\\nSong #265: \\"My Proud Mountains\\"\\nWho Made it: Townes Van Zandt\\nYear: 1969\\n_______________________________\\n\\n\\nThoughts: Mostly all above.

If Boat Songs is heavy on the Sports & Entertainment side of trivia, Manning Fireworks fills out the Religion slice of the pie. Like Matt, MJ\'s earlier work dropped Catholic crumbs that are moving towards a full on meal as of late. Aside from Catholic Priest, the only other pre-Fireworks track that comes close to qualifying is Knockin\', and even that\'s a bit of a stretch. On Manning Fireworks, the accoutrements of the altar are inescapable. MJ gets positively papal, dropping references on the title track, Joker Lips, Rudolph, Wristwatch, She\'s Leaving You, You Don\'t Know The Shape I\'m In, and On My Knees. Only Rip Torn and Bark At The Moon escape the treatment. Maybe that\'s why they\'re at the bottom of the playcount bucket; his fans need Jesus. Or at least need someone who no longer needs Jesus. Gentle plug for East of Eden if you like that flavor. \\n\\n\\nPSA: be not tempted to buy the POS Manning Fireworks vinyl on amazon for $20.02. It\'s warped like wet wood. Album art really pops at full scale, though.\\n\\n\\nReply from Matt Radosevich: \\"Damned if you don\'t, damned if you do\\" doesn\'t count @Jack Greene ?\\n\\n\\nReply from Jack Greene: Guess I\'ll call my list rip torn. Eight in a row, unless someone can baptize Bark.\\n\\n\\nReply from Ethan Cook: I\'ve been up too late with Guitar Hero playing \\"Bark At The Moon\\"\\n\\n\\nA song within a song. If Ozzy doesn\'t scream post-Catholic-upbringing rage then I don\'t know what does:\\n\\n\\nThey cursed and buried Him along with shame\\nAnd thought His timeless soul had gone, gone\\nIn empty burning the unholy one\\nBut He\'s returned to prove them wrong, so wrong\\n\\n\\nNine in a row for Manning Fireworks.

But I bear unfortunate news. Unless the Head Author (through some unprecedented wave of common sense) decides to assign me more songs, this is my final F&L contribution. I\u2019ll get to today\u2019s song momentarily, because Luke Bell deserves one more moment in the spotlight. But first, I want to dig into an intriguing statement that the Head Author wrote in F&L #246. To many, this would have been easy to gloss over. A real fly-over sentence. Or maybe you were like me and found it to be a prime insight for some light mathematical analysis. Here\u2019s the line in question:\\n\\n\\n\u201cPutting a 45 minute timer on this one. Whatever gets done gets done.\u201d\\n\\n\\nForty-five minutes. That\u2019s a known constant - the time it took to write F&L #246. Another known constant? That entry was 244 words long. That comes out to 5.42 words per minute. It would be easy to criticize the pace here. But that isn\u2019t too important to me. What is important to me is that, at the time I write this (January 31), the F&L archive is 104,263 words long. Let\u2019s now make the assumption that 5.42 words per minute is the Head Author\u2019s standard pace. That means He has spent approximately 13.5 days writing this newsletter since May 10th, 2024. I know that there have been guest features that eat into that time. Maybe that was a particularly slow writing day. And you might even be saying to yourself, \u201cLJ, that\u2019s not even that crazy. People spend way more time doing way stupider stuff every day.\u201d That\u2019s not my point. My point is that this man has spent two entire weeks of his year writing an alt-country newsletter every single day and sends it to a collection of people for free who\u2019s interest levels range from \u201cI can\u2019t wait to hear today\u2019s song\u201d to \u201cwhen will this fucking guy add an \u2018Unsubscribe\u2019 button?\u201d As I see it, this behavior is indicative of one of two possibilities: \\n\\n\\n1. The Head Author is a caring, insightful, passionate friend who is trying to stay in touch with the most important people in his life through a means that he finds engaging and fun.\\n2. The Head Author is a verifiable sociopath.\\n\\n\\nI\u2019ve known Him since 1st grade and I\u2019ll be quite frank - I think it\'s a complete tossup. So, we all have a couple of options for how to handle the next 90+ days.\\n\\n\\n1. Embrace the fact that someone cares enough about you to invest this much time into a pro bono project with the sole intent of enlightening and brightening your life. Thank Him. Embrace Him. Tell Him you appreciate Him.\\n2. Run. Cut ties. Change your email address. Change your residence. Hell, maybe even consider changing your name. Because there\u2019s a chance that once F&L ends, \u201cdaily email newsletter\u201d quickly becomes \u201cunannounced appearance from behind your shower curtain.\u201d\\n\\n\\nFood for thought\u2026\\n\\n\\nAnyhow. Today\u2019s song is \u201cWhere Ya Been\u201d by Luke Bell. Be forewarned, it\'s another sad Luke Bell song (just as the previous two have been). If your Saturday calls for a little more lovin\u2019 than fussin\u2019, stop reading now and instead listen to my personal favorite Luke bell song: \u201cGlory and the Grace.\u201d Let that one wash over you.\\n\\n\\n\u201cWhere Ya Been\u201d is another one of those songs that could trick you into thinking it\u2019s happy if you aren\u2019t too honed in on the lyrics. The guitar rings like it\u2019s being played in a long tunnel. And Bell\u2019s twangy, honky-tonky voice always makes me smile. Lyrically, however, this one is about as gloomy as it gets. Maybe you\u2019ll remember from my first ever F&L feature I mentioned that Bell suffered from bipolar disorder and drug abuse, ultimately leading to his early and tragic death just a few years ago. With that context in mind, the song gets even more sad. If you really want to turn on the waterworks, watch this video, where his dad says \u201cThe thing that really brought the light to me was when he wrote that song\u2026 \u2018Where Ya Been.\u2019 That really touched home, in my opinion. That should be the poster song for mental illness.\u201d Brutally sad.\\n\\n\\nNot too much more to say here. It\u2019s a beautiful song with a tragic backstory. Definitely not alone on this playlist. But seriously, if you skipped my earlier recommendation to listen to \u201cGlory and the Grace,\u201d do it now. I promise it will leave you in better spirits.\\n\\n\\nWith that, I take my final bow as a guest contributor. It has been the honor of a lifetime. Thanks for reading (or more likely skimming) over the past few months. And remember, if I go missing, tell the police to start their investigation with this man:\\n\\n\\n Screenshot 2025-02-01 114245.png \\n\\n\\n\u2013LJ","artistWiki":"https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=71306070","albumWiki":"https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=49643499","relatedArtists":{"album":[],"other":["Luke Bell"]}},{"number":269,"song":"Jenny Brown","artist":"The Gourds","album":"Dem\'s Good Beeble","spotifyLink":"https://open.spotify.com/track/6uIGokqWZY8SXEP45vM7is","textBody":"2-2-2025: Jenny Brown\\n\\n\\n_____________________________\\n\\n\\nSong #269: \\"Jenny Brown\\"\\nWho Made it: The Gourds\\nYear: 1996\\n_______________________________\\n\\n\\nThoughts: Mysterious as ever.

In an F&L first, there\'ll be dual authorship on today\'s report. Subscriber/IRL friend Olivia came with me last night. With only minor prompting, she agreed to contribute her own dispatch, which follows below.\\n\\n\\n_____________________________\\nConcert Notes Part 1: Olivia\\n\\n\\nLast night I went to Lenderman with Lead Author. It turns out MJ is a popular artist, we weren\u2019t even the only attendees from our humble Math Department. LA wanted to arrive at 7:30 (the doors opened at 7 and the show started at 8), but I thought that that would be ridiculous so we got there at 8 (still too early imo). The opener was, fine. To quote LA, \u201cAll the songs sounded the same.\u201d Thanks to all the references to Lenderman that appear in this newsletter (but never as the featured song in my subscription tenure because of obscure rules about \u201cwhat counts as country\u201d) I was able to sufficiently prepare. Overall a great performance; it was cool to see his embodied voice, there were lots of great guitar licks, they burn incense and drink what I can only assume is tea on stage. One song that got me that I hadn\u2019t heard previously was \u201cNo Mercy\u201d: \\n\\n\\nTo say that I love you\\nIs more than the truth \\nIt is th\u0435 drywall under my roof   . . .\\n\\n\\nIf we meet up \\nIn the next land \\nI will be your enemy   . . . \\nI will give you my pain\\n\\n\\nThe screaming/singing really is even more effective live.\\n\\n\\n\u2013Olivia\\n\\n\\n_____________________________\\nConcert Notes Part 2: Matt\\n\\n\\nFor the record, 7:30 was my walked-back offer. 7:15 was what I had in my head, but I didn\'t want to sound \\"ridiculous\\" \u2014 so much for that. Also, I prefer to think of my rules as nuanced rather than obscure.\\n\\n\\nOn that note, let\'s get the bad news out of the way. Our guy Xandy Chelmis caught a debilitating case of food poisoning and had to skip the show. He came out to set up, sat for a while, then beat a hasty retreat. That meant no pedal steel and no fiddle \u2014 no clarinet either, but we can\'t pin that on Xandy.\\n\\n\\nThe rest of The Wind did a strong job of picking up the slack. The result was something less countrified than I\'d expected, but still really, really, (really) good. It was lean, loud, and gazey. Feedback abounded. I think they played everything off Manning Fireworks (including the title track as opener), four from Boat Songs, one from GOYGS, all of Lucky, and a few others.\\n\\n\\nSome of my favorites: \\"Basketball #2\\" was one I didn\'t get into until the last week or two before the show, but was in my top three of the night. It came out in 2019. Since Lenderman was born in \'99 (Feb 4, actually), he must\'ve been about 20 at the time of recording. That was prime-time for me w.r.t. feeling glum in silly situations at parties and w.r.t. drinking game prowess, which makes this pair of lines eerily resonant:**\\n\\n\\nEmbarrassed to feel blue\\nIn my Halloween muscle suit . . .\\n\\n\\nThere is nothin\' worse\\nThan dancing when you don\'t wanna\\nSo I try to stay busy \\nWinning at beer pong\\n\\n\\nDarkhorse of the night: they pulled out a cover of \\"Dancing in the Club\\" by This is Lorelei (who played with them earlier in the tour). I was skeptical when they announced it \u2014 never heard of the band/was hoping for DBT \u2014 but they won me over. It\'s in the content sweet spot of not exactly like something you\'d hear on MF, but close enough to sound right**. Plus, it\'s got lyrics that ought to appeal to our angsty Steely Dan contingent:***\\n\\n\\nAnd I sang into my phone\\nI ate my dinner in the dark\\nAnd I fucked up my guitar\\nWhile I was fucking up my heart\\n\\n\\nWhile I was singing Steely Dan\\nCrying \\"Shake it\\" in the wind\\nYeah, a loser never wins\\nAnd I\'m a loser, always been\\n\\n\\nHere\'s a pretty decent recording of MJ + Wind\'s version from a recent show in Athens.\\n\\n\\nLastly: due to further instances of the aforementioned food poisoning, the crew almost didn\'t come back for an encore. They rallied, though, and managed one more with gusto. \\"Knockin\' \\" was the closer. Like Deputy Author Olivia said w.r.t. \\"No Mercy\\", the live screaming is something else. Unclear if DA could hear me belting the knockin\'s, but I was.\\n_____________________________\\n\\n\\nSong #273: \\"Pick Your Nose\\"\\nWho Made it: Cowboy\\nYear: 1971\\n_______________________________\\n\\n\\nThoughts: Almost forgot about this part. Here\'s some Cowboy.\\n\\n\\n\u2013Matt\\n\\n\\nPS: The music video for \\"No Mercy\\" is heavily Uncle Rico coded, which adds support to my conviction that our generation\'s greatest artists are all Dynamite fans. Pure coincidence that I wore my Rico watch last night.\\n\\n\\nNotice that if you go to Jake Lenderman\'s YouTube page, there\'s a five video \\"Favorites\\" playlist, including the classic \\"Top 100 dunks before 2007 still best in 2018\\".\\n\\n\\n*The universal-specificity of the \\"Basketball #2\\" lines reminds me of another all-time great that hounds me from time to time:\\n\\n\\nWell, I know that you\'re in love with him\\n\'Cause I saw you dancin\' in the gym.\\n\\n\\n(From \\"American Pie\\", of course)\\n\\n\\n**Interesting to note: unlike most MJ songs, this is first person, a.o.t. a character piece. Sort of like with \\"Old Black Hen\\" (#108), I wonder if the choice of this as a cover has anything to do with getting some hard thoughts out with safety-padding in place (i.e. \\"I didn\'t write it; I just sang it\\"). If you\'re truly conspiratorially minded, you can watch this other recording with Karly Hartzman on stage and try to read the stray glances. I (personally) have no experience with speaking through songs by proxy, so I won\'t dig in too much.\\n\\n\\n***Not naming names.","artistWiki":"https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=167744","albumWiki":"https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=1777908","relatedArtists":{"album":[],"other":[]}},{"number":274,"song":"Raising Hell","artist":"Lucero","album":"Lucero","spotifyLink":"https://open.spotify.com/track/6b8gKujuXma3xu0djOYJzr","textBody":"2-7-2025: Raising Hell\\n_____________________________\\n\\n\\nSong #274: \\"Raising Hell\\"\\nWho Made it: Lucero\\nYear: 2001\\n_______________________________\\n\\n\\nThoughts: It\'s been a while since we heard from Lucero.

And as usual, references to brothers and distant familial geography add hefty associations. Toss on some rippin\' steel and we\'ve got ourselves a ringer.\\n\\n\\nI\'ve made this point before, but it\'s worth reiterating: Ben Nichols (the guy singing) isn\'t as old as he sounds (or wasn\'t in 2001). I can\'t find an exact birthday, but he\'s pretty fresh-faced in this video. It\'s notable, also, for the \\"early 2000s\\" imagery, the acoustified riffs from the man on the floor, and the careful distinction between \'hell\' (acceptable) and \'shit\' (unacceptable) w.r.t. Radio-friendliness.\\n\\n\\nHere\'s the pre-climax, marked by heavier drums and riffage:\\n\\n\\nAs for me, the same old shit\\nIs pulling me on down\\nNever been quite able\\nTo pick myself up off the ground\\nAlways got big plans\\nBut they\'re always in the works\\nAnd I swear they\'d pay off\\nIf my luck don\'t give out first\\n\\n\\nAnd here\'s the climax, with more of the same (+extra pedal):\\n\\n\\nWell here I am again\\nDon\'t know if I\'m right\\nBut I can tell you that I\'m havin\' fun\\nSo I give it one more shot\\nBecause this race here ain\'t quite done\\nI hit the ground and run\\n\\n\\nThe standout line to me is \'don\'t know if I\'m right\'.

Likewise, \'boots\' are staples. There\'s a cut on my chin today, but just because I switched razors. The rest is beyond. Hard nights need nonesuch floors, nor stings need cuts. \'Shame\' is its own beast. The grit matters; the scene doesn\'t. Maintain some bile and fluster the big-wigs:\\n\\n\\nCome Monday morning\\nI\'ll be sore to a fare-thee-well.\\nCussin\' God and America\\nBeggin\' them both just to send me off to hell.\\n\\n\\n\'God and America\' indeed.

This is late career Van Zandt.\\n_____________________________\\n\\n\\nSong #276: \\"Lover\'s Lullaby\\"\\nWho Made it: Townes Van Zandt\\nYear: 1994\\n_______________________________\\n\\n\\nThoughts: I\'ll acknowledge that this recording of \\"Lover\'s Lullaby\\" might not appeal to the acousti-purists out there. It took time to grow on me, so give it a few chances. If you can\'t get over the heightened production, though, you have options. There\'s the spare rendition on The Highway Kind (the first posthumous album), and this jaw-dropping/heart-breaking live video.\\n\\n\\nEveryone should watch the video. If you\'re busy, watch it instead of clicking the list pick. My main gripe with \\"LL\\" on No Deeper Blue is that it sounds artificially strong, like a de-aged Harrison Ford. The reverb and layers mask the cracks in Van Zandt\'s voice \u2014 it\'s believable, but only if you don\'t know better. The real thing comes through a few times (like the first \'there\' at 0:40), which gives the song its life.\\n\\n\\nIn the video, \\"life\\" is clearer. More cracks, more swallows. The weakening strengthens it. Van Zandt starts by saying \\"I\'ve written a few love songs, and this might be the prettiest,\\" which is hard to disagree with. So by the end, when he wipes his eye, you might do the same.\\n\\n\\nIs this our only lullaby? Probably, unless you count \\"WTWGIS\\" (#69) or \\"AMOT\\" (#222). With any luck it\'ll work, and you\'ll rest with kind wishes:\\n\\n\\nSleep babe, till the moon slips away\\nI\'m hopin\' all you\'re dreamin\' comes true\\nWhen you rise with the day\\nI might not have too much to say\\nBut you know that doesn\'t mean that I don\'t love you\\nOh, you know that doesn\'t mean that I don\'t love you\\n\\n\\nAgain, the video\'s more convincing, especially with the last bit.

We all know it. If you didn\'t know it before, you heard it in  The Last of Us.* It\'s Ronstadt\'s fifth and the week\'s third. It puts the \\"and\\" in our name.\\n\\n\\nGary White wrote it. He was friends with JJ Walker. For some of the backstory, you can watch this video, which starts with a great quote:\\n\\n\\n\\"It\'s like cowboys are just runnin\' around with a gittar, gettin\' stuck somewheres, writin\' a song about wantin\' to be back when they get enough money. And then they get some money, and they go get stuck somewheres else again, and . . . pretty soon they have a career.\\"\\n\\n\\nThe sound quality on the video is terrible, but it\'s worth a watch for the Loyd Maines spotting. The hi-fi version\'s on Spotify.\\n\\n\\nFor all his strumming, Walker can\'t hold a candle to Ronstadt. It\'s her song, through and through. Listen to how she shifts her voice in the first verse, changing perspective from \\"well-meant-advice\\" to \\"heart-in-the-midst\\":\\n\\n\\nLove will abide\\nTake things in stride\\nSounds like good advice\\nBut there\'s no one at my side\\nAnd time washes clean love\'s wounds unseen\\nThat\'s what someone told me\\nBut I don\'t know what it means\\n\\n\\nThat\'s how it goes. Wisdom wilts in action. We get our own moments, which we live first and last.  We can\'t neuter them, no matter how many \\"there-there\\"\'s we try. The rear view, clear and detached, loses scale.

But, I should also clear the air: longtime readers will remember me writing some unflattering things about Rodney Crowell. To be explicit (lest I snub*), Crowell is the third voice you hear for most of the song \u2014 and he does a great job. I\'ve come full circle on Rod. He\'s an underdog. Plucky. Good writer. Nice head of hair.\\n\\n\\n RC_GC.jpg \\n\\n\\n(Rod and Guy)\\n\\n\\nOn \\"Anyhow\\", though, Rod draws the short straw. He\'s sharing vocal space with some heavy hitters. He holds his own up until the three minute mark, but when bigshot Waylon joins in, Rod fades out. And since the ending\'s so memorable, I usually forget who did the legwork for the first three quarters \u2014 mia culpa, Rod.\\n\\n\\nBe better than me. Give the man his due.*\\n\\n\\n****************************\\n\\n\\nHeadspace recommendation: we\'re neck deep in the week. Afford yourself some romance. Put someone in mind. If you have to, pretend. Recall Guy and Susanna. Watch the documentary, or look at this picture:\\n GC_SC.jpg \\n\\n\\nIf you\'re still cynical, watch this \u2014 tender as it gets.\\n\\n\\n****************************\\n\\n\\nNow, loudly: there is no part of this song that I don\'t love. If all you did were to read the title and listen through the first lines, that\'d be plenty:\\n\\n\\nI wish I had a dime\\nFor every bad time\\nBut the bad times always seem to keep the change\\n\\n\\nHall of fame opening. Bad times always seem to keep the change? Come on. Then, it gets better: the chorus, the rhythm, the swell \u2014 months of verve in a twenty second span:\\n\\n\\nJust you wait until tomorrow \\nWhen you wake up with me \\nAt your side and find \\nI haven\'t lied about nothin\'.\\n\\n\\nAnd I wouldn\'t trade a tree\\nFor the way I feel\\nAbout you in the mornin\'\\nAnyhow, I love you.\\n\\n\\nHear how the \'just you...\' dawdles slightly, then the ball gets rolling? Guy counts \'em in. It\'s all so confident, so sure, that you wonder if it\'s a bluff. Who, after all, hasn\'t lied about nothin\'?\\n\\n\\nBluff or not, I trust the foundation \u2014 any fib is surface deep. The feeling is right, all through to mornin\'.\\n\\n\\nThen there\'s the last line. The wallop. Practically, what\'s with the \'anyhow\'?\\n\\n\\nI say another reversal, like adverbs or gruffness. Not to dismiss, but to allow, to ease. Again, to get the ball rolling. This goes back to what was happening on \\"Dublin Blues\\", so I\'ll repeat what I wrote (and foreshadowed) there: Clark knows how to say it. If he needs the anyhow  \u2014 a sheen of nonchalance, a stutter, a tic \u2014 so be it. This is not mundane; this is not easy. It also goes back to \\"The Promise\\" (#142), w.r.t. \\"heavy words\\" bouncing and looking for cracks. \\n\\n\\nBetter to walk with a crutch.**\\n\\n\\nClock\'s at 10:45. This is also important:\\n\\n\\nEveryday it gets\\nJust a little bit better\\nAnd half of gettin\' there is knowin\' where I been before\\n\\n\\nThat last line\'ll come up again on big #300, along with some sort of reveal.\\n\\n\\n****************************\\n\\n\\nNow, about the ending: with fifty seconds left, the song-that-keeps-on-giving busts out a fourth voice. A famous voice. I bet there\'s a good story out there about how Jennings wound up on the track. As it is, without overshadowing what\'s already in place, he adds enough oomph to bring it home big.\\n\\n\\nTime\'s up. Enjoy your Fridays.\\n\\n\\n\u2013Matt\\n\\n\\nPS/YouTube Interlude: here\'s the video to watch. \xc0 la \\"Lover\'s Lullaby\\", it\'s a pared down, age-advanced, heart-touching rendition. Don\'t be angry with the lady who yells \\"thank you\\" over the opening lines \u2014 she\'s happy. I think it\'s a nice side-effect of the lowish quality recording that the two guitars merge into one uber-sound, which makes it seem like Guy has really been practicing. And, he\'s funny \u2014 note the delivery on \'nothin\'\' and \'don\'t\'. ***\\n\\n\\nExtra credit: read more into \\"I got a little lost there\\".\\n\\n\\n*Unlike this review from \\"Americana UK\\":\\n\\n\\n RC_Snub.png \\n\\n\\nOuch.

Roommate\'s out of town, so I\'m enjoying uninterrupted time in the rarely used living room. I spun some Kristofferson earlier, baked some tofu, and cracked a couple Shiners. It\'s chilly enough outside to feel good, but not chilly enough to run the heater \u2014 a sweater does fine.\\n\\n\\nGood timing for some 97\'s.

It joins the ranks of \\"songs that came at the right time.\\" The right time, for me, was when \\"not wanting to leave\\" was thick in my mind. I heard it (loosely, distracted) before leaving, then queued it up again after.\\n\\n\\nI was home; I was mulling. I had the legal pad out that I keep in my desk: not for posterity, but for on-the-spot parsing. I tried some songs for help \u2014 Lenderman, likely* \u2014 then came to \\"Wait Up\\". From the primary source, here\'s my appraisal:\\n\\n\\n WU_1.jpg \\n\\n\\nThe last words (forgive the handwriting) are \\"hit hard\\", which understate the impact. This was the line that got me:\\n\\n\\n WU_2.jpg \\n\\n\\nThe eyes welled up at that point. Felt like Tweedy had a bead on me\u2014 like he\'d been watching me struggle to tie my shoes (to buy an extra minute) and written me back in time.\\n\\n\\nA few days later (i.e. now), I thought about \'guess\' \u2014 a small, surly word. Something about it snagged me, reminding me of notes-gone-by. This led to a quick ctrl + f in the archive, which led to \\"Come Tomorrow\\" (#218). Recall the lines:\\n\\n\\nI guess that no amount of lying\\nTo myself will stop the crying\\nI guess I have to take things like they are\\n\\n\\nIt\'s strange that that\'s how it was. Here\'s what I said then:\\n\\n\\n\\"I started this one early enough that most of today felt like \\"tomorrow\\". Something woke me up at 4:30 (could be ____, could be ______ ) and kept me too wired to get back to sleep. I grabbed my headphones and got down to business. The early hours added perspective.\\"\\n\\n\\nStranger still: the same thing (the early wakeup) happened again today. I played it coy then with \\"c.b _____, c.b. ______\\", but couldn\'t have fooled anyone. The blanks then weren\'t blank, nor are they today. You and I and Jeff all know the reason:\\n\\n\\nI miss you more than I need sleep.**\\n\\n\\nI\'ll point out that Tweedy\'s barely singing this song. It\'s near spoken word. Some debate as to whether the encounter at hand is on the phone or in person, but it feels direct. This is one where I firmly (mostly) take the writer\'s perspective, speaking from me rather than to me.\\n\\n\\nGot about ten minutes left before I hit send. Much more I\'d like to say, but this\'ll have to do. Here\'s the last line:\\n\\n\\nI need you and I can\'t keep up this speed\\n\\n\\nThe speed remains mysterious. There\'s another layer in \'wait up\' (as in \\"stay awake\\") vs. \'wait up\' (as in \\"slow down\\"), but we\'ll leave it at that.\\n\\n\\nWell worth the wait.\\n\\n\\n\u2013Matt\\n\\n\\nPS: The spaced-out slowdowns at 0:49, 1:37, and 1:46 are interesting.

Wrote Guthrie in \'42: \u201cOmar Khayy\xe1m (Islamic mystic poet in the Sufi-verse) seems to have been sorta of a hillbilly hisself, because he took the words right out of my mouth.\u201d Read here for more deets on that connection, and Guthrie\'s recording of Khayyam\'s Rubaiyat. If it\'s good enough for him...\\n- Country music was a category dreamt up by marketers to differentiate \\"hill-billy\\" from \\"race records\\" to segment rural poors. All is one, we are all man, let your silly categories slough off you like acid rain.\\n\\n\\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\\nSo does the winding thread of Sufi music take us from Khayyam to Guthrie to this tune by UNFAK, Ustad (Teacher) Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan. Jeff Buckley described him thusly: \\"Part Buddha, part demon, part mad angel...his voice is velvet fire... I\'ve seen Nusrat and his party repeatedly melt New Yorkers into human beings...\\" Other fans included Michael Jackson, Sting, Eddie Vedder (a Nusrat-obsessive who saw him live multiple times any chance he could), Brian Eno, Massive Attack, Martin Scorcese, Peter Gabriel and U2, says the LA Times. Buckley even played a version of Suroor live, if you want some quirked up white boy magic.\\n\\n\\nThe Ustad came from a family that\'s been doing this sort of thing for a few hundred years. It\'s annoying to introduce Khan as the paragon of the art form, which he is, because he\'s deeply odd. Totally improvisational, able to segue into Western pop, traditional classical, movie soundtracks including The Last Temptation of Christ. He invented the category of popular qawwali music, defined it till today, and all in the space of a few decades. Highly recommend minute 9 to 12 on this track to see what all he can do with his voice. \\n\\n\\nFor more on Nusrat, a lovely interview with him by Buckley, where they talk about their fathers\' deaths and Nusrat insists Suroor is only metaphorically about alcohol, the real intoxication is love. Sure, maybe.\\n\\n\\n image.png \\n\\n\\nUNFAK and Jeff B\\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\\nA note before we go deeper. Qawwali music is trance music, and by that I don\'t mean that ketamine-addict fare pumped out by anodic anodynics in Infidel Europe. The idea is you let it wash over you and take you elsewhere. Sufis believe music and dance are about the most reliable ways to get somewhere close to God. I\'ve seen some of the most tightly wound conservative stick-in-the-mud uncles back home unravel for a Qawwali. If they can do it, you can do it. Groove with it. Feel free to let your attention go in and out, this isn\'t an exam. More on qawwali for a western audience here.\\n\\n\\nOn to the tune.\\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nThe full lyrics are below, but the main thing is getting buzzed off of a woman\'s attention, or possibly actual liquor (due to a woman\'s attention). Urdu songs never get too specific, so it\'s anyone\'s guess.\\n\\n\\nThe first four minutes are poems around that sort of thing. If it\'s feeling a little slow, don\'t fret, it\'ll get faster. Any time you hear sharaab he\'s saying liquor.\\n\\n\\nWe then arrive at the main verse. This is the core of the song, all the improvisation, all the bits revolve around this, you gotta get comfy with it for a while. They riff on it, doing some vocal tricks.\\n\\n\\nThis light, little buzz I got on - ye jo halka halka suroor hai\\nIt\'s your looking at me\u2019s fault - teri nazron ka qusoor hai\\nThat\'s what taught me to drink - ke sharaab peena sikha diya\\n\\n\\nThere\'s a few other verses they also build improvisations around, namely these:\\n\\n\\nTera pyaar hai, mere zindagi\\nYour love is my life\\n\\n\\nand\\nTeri behki behki nigaah ne\\nYour wandering, intoxicated glances\u2014\\nMujhe ik sharaabi bana diya\\nHave turned me into a drunk.\\nMere baad kisko satao gy?\\nWho are you going to torure after me?\\nYou\'ll hear these quite a bit.\\n\\n\\nThe song speeds up and slows down, hitting it\'s highest speed around 14mins. Quick changes in tempo keep you interested for the whole duration. A good qawwal band can keep an audience interested for four or five hours. A great band can do that and induce some out-of-body experiences along the way.\\n\\n\\nGuthrie noted something important (\\"[Khayyam] knew how to put down in a very few words just what it takes for a day\u2019s run.\\") The paucity of words that Sufi poetry (much more effectively in Urdu) allows is powerful for conveying emotions, states of mind, vibes. Take this little bit around 8:55, translated directly with the word musth left in, meaning feisty or crazy or lusty, depending on the context. You can lose pronouns, tenses, is, was. Can just go straight for the jugular, nouns and adjectives, verbs and adverbs.\\n\\n\\nListen along.\\nSaara jahan mast, Jahaan ka nizaam mast\\nWhole world musth. World\'s Order musth.\\nDin mast raat mast sahar mast shaam mast\\nDay musth, night musth, sunrise musth, sunset musth.\\nKhum mast sheesha mast sabuu mast Jaam mast\\nGoblet musth, glass musth, jug musth, cup musth.\\nAnd another example, this one with dropped pronouns, making it really unclear whether we\'re talking God, a lost love, the narrator:\\nPaas rehta hai door rehta hai\\nStays close but remains distant.\\nKoi dil mein zaroor rehta hai\\nBut someone definitely resides in the heart.\\nJab se dekha hai un ki aankhon ko\\nEver since I have seen their (gender neutral but could be the same as above) eyes\u2014\\nHalka halka suroor rehta hai\\nThat light, light buzz lingers\\nThe song goes on, UNFAK alternating between love and horror, hatred of his condition and love of his prison. A thousand synonyms for wiggling, meandering, wavering abound. The words sound right in any language: leher, tahel, behek, that nice bendy H in the middle.\\nThe whole song is that shimmering heat mirage on a hot road, that light, light buzz that persists after she\'s gone.\\nAround minute 13 they start to speed up further, and then they take us all the way to the end, screaming my heart\'s gone, my heart\'s gone.\\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nThe song is idiosyncratic, the themes universal: guilt, love, the deep, deep pleasure of self-annihilation when the right woman, (or the Lord, depending who you ask) comes round. \\nThis has been a challenging FnL, and I thank anyone who checked it out. A final thought to leave you with.\\nFor UNFAK, music was a pure attempt to cliff dive with an audience and take them to ecstasy. To half-ass, to break with the past would be an insult to his father, to his religion, to the Sufi saints, to God. His devotion to it was complete. He spent every waking hour listening to or composing music since he was a child. That\'s the bar, I say. Whenever I walk away from his stuff and go back to something dripping with irony, with excuses, with self-doubt, it turns my stomach. What\'s the point, if you\'re not emptying the tank.\\nIn any case, enjoy this video of Central Park going ape shit for Nusrat\'s 1993 concert. Listen to the insane tablas from 4:43 on, it\'s unbelievable.\\nSome FnL cork-boarding: The Natural-Born Killers OST features a combo track by Cowboy Junkies and John Prine, as well as a UNFAK hit.\\nFor those interested in more chill qawwali, a nice lo-fi chill Nusrat from Massive Attack, and a wonderful collaboration with a Brian Eno protege.\\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nFull Lyrics with some time stamping below:\\nSaaqi ki har nigah pe bal kha ke pii gaya\\nEvery look from the cupbearer, I take a sway and drink.\\nLehron se khelta hua lehra ke pii gaya\\nPlayed with the waves till I wavered about into a drink,\\nAy Rehmat-e-tamaam!

I was listening to Nanci Griffith\'s Other Voices, Other Rooms this morning, which is an album of covers. Listening to it \u2014 especially at this point in the project \u2014 felt like a reunion, or a \\"who\'s who\\" roll-call. You can peruse Wikipedia for the details, but here\'s a partial list of who chipped in: Kate Wolf, TVZ, Bobby D, Prine, Dement, Jerry Jeff, Emmylou, Chet Atkins, Guy Clark, John Hartford, Alison Krauss . . .\\n\\n\\nDo you feel close to these names yet? Any friendly fondness? I hope at least a little.\\n\\n\\nIt got me appreciating how strong the \\"cover culture\\" is in this niche. I know it\'s not the only genre where people play each other\'s songs, but it feels particularly earnest here \u2014 maybe from all those kitchen table singalong videos. The \\"red-threading\\" I do is fun, but I think it also shows how involved with each other these folks all were (and are).\\n\\n\\nGriffith, with Prine, does a cover of \\"Speed of the Sound of Loneliness\\". Vile also does \\"SoTSoL\\". I picked \\"How Lucky\\" instead (and the duet instead of Prine\'s original) because I\'m feeling more lucky than lonely today, and because singing with friends is better than singing alone.\\n\\n\\nI almost saw KV in the spring of 2020. I bought two tickets and had them pinned over my bed for a couple months in advance. Things happened as they did, though, and the concert got canceled. KV and JP played some shows together before that (when the world still ran), and there\'s footage of them singing \\"Lucky\\" a few months before Prine died.\\n\\n\\n KV_JP.jpg \\n\\n\\nThe best part of the video is watching them shake hands and smile at the end.

Today\'s the day to see.\\n_____________________________\\n\\n\\nSong #314: \\"One Paper Kid\\"\\nWho Made it: Emmylou Harris\\nYear: 1978\\n_______________________________\\n\\n\\nThoughts: There it is. The big \\"reveal\\".\\n\\n\\nI know at least one of you pulled some google tricks to find this song before its time, and others might have come across it naturally. It\'s out in the open now.\\n\\n\\nThis is one I\'ve built toward.*\\n\\n\\nThink back to May 9th, 2024. It was my birthday. Two things, among other things, were on my mind: the analysis qual I\'d take the next morning, and the debut of my semi-planned, semi-relevant, country-adjacent newsletter. I\'d picked out a year\'s worth of songs, sketched a rough format, and wrangled some subscribers. I knew which song would come first, but I didn\'t have a title.\\n\\n\\nSo, instead of memorizing Schwarz lemma, I walked around campus to brainstorm. I\'d been collecting my picks in a playlist called \\"Countr(ey)vangelism\\"**, but I didn\'t like the undertones. I wanted something less punny, less preachy. I thought it\'d make sense to work backward from the material. I asked myself which song I most wanted to share, and which line hit me hardest.\\n\\n\\nThis is what we got.\\n\\n\\n*********************************\\n\\n\\nWhy now? Why not the finale? Mainly, I guess, because it\'s better \\"in the midst\\". It\'s not a closer \u2014 more on this below. I\'d hate to risk undue pretense, i.e. feigning final understanding. It\'d be a little too cute to put this at the end, to draw up the bow and leave with a wink. Pragmatically, also, I\'ve got some time this week \u2014 I\'m making some time this week \u2014 and I\'ve got the urge to move.\\n\\n\\nPlenty of good songs left, but denouement approaches.\\n\\n\\n*********************************\\n\\n\\nThe \\"thoughts\\" on \\"Kid\\" blend in with the preamble. The song is the project is the artist is the story is the process and so forth. \\n\\n\\nWho could it be but Emmylou? Willie, sure, is a star, but he\'s not our star. \\n\\n\\nMath fact: by my counting, Harris has featured on 25 out of our 314 songs so far, for a whopping 8%. That\'s more than anyone else. Beyond standard proportion, she leads on songs that make me want to write.\\n\\n\\nI was listening through her F&L chronology this morning (3-17), waxing nostalgic. She brought back memories: looping \\"RotGA\\" while I moved apartments in May, making faces at Black Hole to \\"Ashes By Now\\", driving back from Lafayette (i.e. \\"Leaving Louisiana\\"), and packing for Christmas with \\"The Boxer\\" in the background \u2014 all in the last ten months.\\n\\n\\nMaybe the biggest success of this playlist, for me, has been pinning down moments like those \u2014 sampling a rich year. It makes my self more tangible.\\n\\n\\n*********************************\\n\\n\\nI went to Black Hole (my preferred coffee shop) this morning (3-17) to get some notes started. I wrote a bunch there this summer, but I hadn\'t been back in a while. The morning was cool enough that I could sit out on the east-facing patio and catch the morning rays without baking.\\n\\n\\nPartial alignment here: no Camels***, yes coffee, no cold morning winds.\\n\\n\\nTruth be told, the shades hid some redness. I think I\'ll miss the list. I\'ve had daily chances to share, to delve, to preach and praise. I\'ve chafed, sometimes, at my (wholly self-imposed) expectations, and often savored the habit.\\n\\n\\nIt\'s been a foil: sometimes, the songs feel foreign. I wouldn\'t pick the same set yesterday that I picked last year, nor tomorrow that I\'d pick today. This is good: to paraphrase something that Osman said to me on the phone a few weeks ago, it\'d be a failure if I ended the year exactly as into \\"sad alt-country\\" as I\'d been at the outset.\\n\\n\\nI\'ll clarify/justify, though, that I maintain full respect for these songs. Very, very few \\"punts\\" have stemmed from indifference. When I\'ve had time and still gone short, it\'s more often been from excess of feeling than lack of it.\\n\\n\\nExpanding: think of an engine.^ If you want to understand it, you should de-construct it, re-construct it, analyze and tinker. When I\'ve been up for the task, that\'s what I\'ve done. But, if you want an engine to work for you, you should leave it under the hood. You don\'t want to run it by hand.\\n\\n\\nSo too here: picking-apart is good, but not every day. If I were an unattached, impartial observer, maybe I\'d have consistently delivered 500 word, standard-sized missives. There\'s no heart in that, though. I\'m subject to the same whims and humours that I try to hear, which makes for slippery business.\\n\\n\\nAnyway, much to say. Time to get down to it.\\n*********************************\\n\\n\\nWe can start with this: \'Tomorrow came too fast, but he didn\'t mind\'.\\n\\n\\nWhat\'s in not minding? A good bit of faith, I\'d say: faith that there\'s good in tomorrow, or past tomorrow, or through tomorrow. I\'ll recall \\"rose-tinting\\" and \\"pedestal-ing\\" and excess rear-view fixation. An unwelcome \'tomorrow\' says more about the twist of your neck than it does about itself: too caught up behind to welcome what\'s next.\\n\\n\\n\\"Kid\' goes both ways. The bridge remembers; the verses expect:\\n\\n\\nThe driver was drunk or he just didn\'t see^^\\nThe future was there it\'ll happen to me\\n And all the time that he\'d wasted was his once again\\nIt never takes too long to go where you\'ve been\\n\\n\\nPair that last line with one from the first verse: \'It don\'t take no time to get where I am\'. If you\'ve paid attention, you might remember Guy Clark saying something similarly structured on #280: \'half of gettin\' there is knowin\' where I been before\'. Recall, also, that Emmylou sang on \\"Anyhow\\", which came out two years before \\"Kid\\" \u2014 enough coincidence to send me sleuthing.\\n\\n\\nHere\'s the red-thread. Emmylou didn\'t write \\"Kid\\". The man who did was named Walter Martin Cowart.\\n\\n\\nHow did Cowart\'s song come to Harris? Some guesswork here, but I\'ll present the facts. During his time at SFASU (Nacogdoches), Rodney Crowell started a band (a \\"folk duo\\") with Cowart\'s younger brother. Crowell describes Cowart as \\"a pot-smoking, Bob Dylan-quoting poet, songwriter, and long-haul trucker and instant role-model\\" \u2014 thus establishing the Cowart/Crowell connection.\\n\\n\\nWhat about Crowell/Harris? We\'ve heard the results, but haven\'t gotten the story. To my delight, I found that Skinny Dennis (see #104, #170) is the missing link. Here, Crowell describes meeting Dennis in a Nashville bar in the early seventies:\\n\\n\\n\\"One evening I was looking for an empty booth where I could enjoy my free supper when I noticed a six-foot-seven, one-hundred-and-forty-pound humanoid leaning on a cue next to the pool table. As I passed by, he hocked up a giant loogie and spat it into my beer. \'You won\u2019t be needing any of this now, will ya?\' Sneering, he grabbed the pitcher out of my hand and started glugging. I was surprised to hear myself say \'I guess this means we\u2019re gonna be friends,\' and even more so when \'Give me half of that hamburger and we\u2019ll see,\' was his response.\\" \\n\\n\\nThrough Dennis, Crowell met Clark and joined those famous singalongs. And in an apartment he shared with Dennis, Crowell held meetings that eventually got his \\"Bluebird Wine\\" demo into Harris\'s hands. It wound up as the opening track on her second album.\\n\\n\\nWhen Dennis died, Crowell was a pallbearer at his funeral. I couldn\'t find any pictures of Crowell and Dennis together, but here\'s a suitable stand-in.\\n\\n\\n TVZ_SD.webp \\n\\n\\nIn summary: the same very tall man who brought about my favorite bar also brought about my (maybe) favorite song.\\n\\n\\nHow\'s that for a \'crop of kismet\'?\\n\\n\\n*********************************\\nOnto the bridge that says it all:\\n\\n\\nBroken hearts scattered all over the past\\nOld bad memories tryin\' to last\\nWhiskey and women and growin\' up fast\\nFussin\' and lovin\' and itchin\' like grass\\n\\n\\nAuditory appreciation: do you hear it? do you get it? Harris and Nelson reach duet perfection. The full \'mem-oh-ries\', the hiss of \'whiskey\', the pain in \'fast\' \u2014 every inflection is precious.\\n\\n\\nAnd the last, titular triptych: there\'s your third pillar. Itchin\' like grass. Hear how Emmylou says it, and how the backing swells? Don\'t you feel brave? It\'s most of what I\'ve been, and that makes me glad. I avoided naming it (for the sake of mild suspense), but I didn\'t ignore it. Flip (metaphorically) through the archive, and you\'ll find it throughout. Any yearning, any vigor, any urge to sing or shout or sprint, to move along and up \u2014 to me, that\'s itchin\'.\\n\\n\\n*********************************\\n\\n\\nNow about the kid. The impression I get is somewhere between \\"folk hero\\" and \\"plain folk\\". More than outlaw grit or noble distance, I hear ordinary, hopeful goodness. The bridge \u2014 phenomenal as it is \u2014 describes anyone. Broken hearts? Bad memories? We\'ve all got \'em. And it may not be whiskey, but we\'ve got some crutch. \\n\\n\\nEvery song I\'ve picked this year fits in those lines. By extension, everything I\'ve done this year (read: every year) fits in those lines. They\'re ever relevant: not necessarily in an acute, poignant way, but always humming in the background.\\n\\n\\nThey\'re good to hold close.\\n\\n\\n*********************************\\n\\n\\nObviously, \\"personal significance\\" is the main factor in what songs made the cut this year and which ones didn\'t. I started listening to \\"Kid\\" in earnest in summer 2022, which was not my finest hour \u2014 a source of some of those \'old bad memories\'.\\n\\n\\nI was in Maine, post second year of teaching, pre (unplanned and unwanted) third year. The summer was particularly rough: fair to say that it stunk, and that I was itching (ha) to get out.\\n\\n\\nSilver lining: I moved into my first (and so far only) solo apartment that year. I had more room than I knew what to do with, so converted the second bedroom into my \\"sanctuary\\". I put all my best stuff in there: art, books, records, pictures. And when I needed to escape the headaches of life-out-of-line, that\'s where I\'d go. Here\'s the panorama:\\n\\n\\n Chill_Room_Pano.jpg \\n\\n\\nI\'d spin Quarter Moon in a Ten Cent Town whenever I got the chance \u2014 mostly to hear \\"Kid\\". It was self-indulgent: I liked to put myself in the song, identifying with the hazily-defined protagonist.\\n\\n\\nDon\'t take that as self-aggrandizement, or as self-pity: as said above, the \'kid\' is pretty standard, and the bridge is universal. Still, it felt good to hear someone take such normal things  \u2014 lonesomeness, lost time, lost love  \u2014 and make them sound so pretty.  When you don\'t like your situation, and you\'re feelin\' unfeelin\', the chorus stands out:\\n\\n\\nThe one paper kid wasn\'t really so mean\\nJust a little bit scared and a little bit green\\nAnd he\'d heard of a place where it\'s legal to dream...\\n\\n\\nI was giving that last line the ol\' logical work-over on my run this morning (3-19). To wit: where isn\'t it legal? I figure that if you \'hear of a place\' and believe it\'s real, then the dream\'s already there. No need to recurse: to dream of a dream is still to dream, n-steps down the line. In that sense, it\'s a sort of self-validating sentence: the only illegal place is the one that\'s numb.\\n\\n\\n*********************************\\n\\n\\nTime to wrap up. Apart from this one, every writeup has been a single day affair. Intentionally, that\'s never been enough time to \\"get it all out\\". The philosophy is to take a \\"cross-section\\" and leave something left to say. I decided to stretch this one out a little, but shouldn\'t push it.\\n\\n\\nSomething obvious that\'s still worth saying: rollin\' isn\'t a place. You don\'t get there, pat yourself on the back, then stop. That\'s part of why \\"Kid\\" isn\'t last: to leave some room for momentum, and to give the song a future.\\n\\n\\nThat\'s all. Hope you like it. \\n\\n\\nWrite on some rocks.\\n\\n\\n\u2013Matt\\n\\n\\nPS1: Guy Clark did it too.^^^ So did Waxahatchee. Neither hold a candle.\\n\\n\\nPS2: You might\'ve expected me to complain about the lack of pedal-steel. And while I do think that a few bars from Kleinow or Maines or DeVito would kick this into overdrive, I trust that it doesn\'t need it. Maybe, even, it\'s better without. The song sounds like it\'s out there with the kid, early in the morning or late in the evening, breathing the desert dust. It\'s no honky-tonk, no dive-bar, no highway-fire. And if the arrangement\'s to fit the scene, it ought to work al fresco. We get that: one harmonica\u207a, one guitar, two voices \u2014 grab a friend and send it up.\\n\\n\\nPS3: Wish Sean a happy birthday.\\n\\n\\n*Rememeber the \\"cowboys\\" line from F&L #1?\\n\\n\\n**I.e. something that might win over the agnostics.\\n\\n\\n***Strictly a side-patio vice.\\n\\n\\n^I know nothing about engines, but happily take part in their grand metaphorical tradition.\\n\\n\\n^^This is about the only tangible shred of \\"plot\\" in the song. I won\'t attempt to parse the details of what it means for the \'kid\', but you might like to sit with the narratorial possibilities.\\n\\n\\n^^^With our boy Rod on backing vocals.\\n\\n\\n\u207aOne perfect harmonica, courtesy of Mickey Raphael.

I hope everyone enjoyed it as much as I did. I follow with my own pair of stars: the Man In Black and the Boss.\\n\\n\\nAlthough Johnny had covered Bruce a time or two, this one is different. It\u2019s deeper cut from Bruce\u2019s later work, a decidedly non-country rocker, and IMHO lacking in its execution. But with a new countrified arrangement and the gravelly voice of age, Johnny absolutely nailed it. But why? Why this song, of all songs?\\n\\n\\nRecorded in the summer of 2003, nearly blind and wheelchair bound, Cash had just weeks left to live. His wife had just passed away in May, and without June, Cash had only music left to live for. Recording when he had the strength, he and producer Rick Rubin* created enough material for two posthumous albums. For the sake of the song.\\n\\n\\nThis is what makes Johnny\u2019s \u201cFurther On Up The Road\u201d so powerful: the voice of a man who had lost what was most dear to him, staring his own death in the face. He had no other option but to persist, create music, and hold his head high.\\n\\n\\nI got a song to sing, to keep me out of the cold\\nI\u2019ll meet you further on up the road\\n\\n\\nThis song got a lot of listens, by me, in the spring of 2020. I felt like I was living in the third verse: out in the desert, looking for a sign. I had a fever burning in my soul. It gave me the idea that there was more than hope, but inevitability, of better times ahead. I think it gave Cash the same idea.\\n\\n\\nOne sunny morning we\u2019ll rise I know\\nAnd I\u2019ll meet you further on up the road\\n\\n\\n*A prolific producer, but the only FnL universe web strand I can find is that he produced for the Chicks, whose member Natalie Maines, is, as we know, the daughter of our pedal steel hero Lloyd Maines.\\n\\n\\n\u2013Ethan","artistWiki":"https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=11983070","albumWiki":"https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=4282951","relatedArtists":{"album":["Johnny Cash","Laura Cash","Dennis Crouch","Smokey Hormel","Pat McLaughlin","Larry Perkins","Jonny Polonsky","Randy Scruggs","Marty Stuart","Matt Sweeney","Benmont Tench","Pete Wade","Mac Wiseman","David Campbell","Martyn Atkins","Christine Cano","John Carter Cash","Lindsay Chase","Greg Fidelman","Paul Figueroa","Dan Leffler","Vlado Meller","Rick Rubin","Mark Santangelo","Jimmy Tittle"],"other":["Johnny Cash","Rick Rubin","Marty Stuart"]}},{"number":316,"song":"(We\'ll Go) Out of Town","artist":"The Silos","album":"The Silos (Bonus Track Version)","spotifyLink":"https://open.spotify.com/track/2RJ3gopPowu4IW20sg6mZW","textBody":"3-21-2025: (We\u2019ll Go) Out of Town\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n_____________________________\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSong #316: (We\'ll Go) Out of Town\\r\\nWho Made it: The Silos\\r\\nYear: 1990\\r\\n_______________________________\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThoughts: Long driving day.

Not even to mention the dead ringer of an album cover.\\n\\n\\nNow to the meat. The stuff we\'ll be breakin\'. The apotheosis of our invisible third pillar, the Holy Ghost in our trilogy, itchin\' like grass: FD distills this tenet down to an essence. An urge like no other.

Not fighting, not talking, not looking, not content, and not loving work. The only things he is doing is being tired, lonesome, and working to provide. There are also some could-do\u2019s and would-do\u2019s mostly wrt the secret third person he aims to share in his loneliness with.\\n\\n\\nAs far as TV dinners, there\u2019s the pre-portioned individual frozen meals (invented in the 50s), then there\u2019s what I do most evenings: streaming the latest cooking, running, SNL, or micro apartment content YouTube has to offer on my propped up phone while I eat. As of today, I\u2019m officially two months into living alone for the first time in my life. It\u2019s pretty luxurious, there\u2019s a freedom to not attending to or minding the needs of a roommate. On the flip side, there has been a many-fold increase in my TV dinner rate (second meaning). I heard on NPR the other morning that the US dropped in happiness rankings again. One of the ways such a thing as happiness is gauged is by asking if respondents had eaten every meal the previous day alone (this has risen some ridiculous percent in the last twenty years). To quote Jenny Lewis \u201cto be lonely is a habit:\u201d TV dinners tend to compound through repetition. \\n\\n\\nAnyways, I\u2019m eating dinner with some friends tonight, we\u2019ve been making a habit of it over the past couple of months. I hope this can be a non-annoying admonition to break bread with someone this week.\\n\\n\\n\u2013 Olivia","artistWiki":"https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=75039072","albumWiki":"https://en.wikipedia.org/?curid=75039072","relatedArtists":{"album":[],"other":[]}},{"number":327,"song":"Houston","artist":"Robert Ellis","album":"The Lights from the Chemical Plant","spotifyLink":"https://open.spotify.com/track/2WBm4WmZprtDmXVPWJ85Rl","textBody":"Song #327: \\"Houston\\"\\r\\nWho Made it: Robert Ellis\\r\\nYear: 2014\\r\\n_______________________________\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThoughts: Many songs thus far have name-dropped Space City, but this is the only one that brings it to the title.

The point isn\'t that it\'s good (though most of it is), but that the \'old man\' puts it out there. \\n\\n\\nIt\'s probably happened to you: someone tries to get through. Wisdom warps through the years. You count the thought, if not the letter, and take some part.\\n\\n\\nThe old man shoots straight. I count fourteen lessons, put in plain commands (do and don\'t). Such need not be so \u2014 folks say things their own way.\\n\\n\\nFor example: my old man sent me two poems in the past two months. The second (\\"Our Real Work\\", Wendell Berry) came by email. It\'s short enough to put here:\\n\\n\\nIt may be that when we no longer know what to do\\nwe have come to our real work,\\nand that when we no longer know which way to go\\nwe have come to our real journey.\\nThe mind that is not baffled is not employed.\\nThe impeded stream is the one that sings.\\n\\n\\nThe first (\\"Desiderata\\", Max Enhrmann) was printed on the back of a note with my 1099-INT.\\n\\n\\n PoeticTaxes.jpg \\n\\n\\nI keep it in my red box of treasures, along with a two dollar bill and this picture of Osman:\\n\\n\\n ORKXmas.jpg \\n\\n\\n(Handsome lad)\\n\\n\\n**************************************\\nClosing quote:\\n\\n\\nSo don\'t let \'em take who you are boy, and don\'t try to be who you ain\'t\\nAnd don\'t let me catch you in Kendale with a bucket of wealthy man\'s paint\\n\\n\\nThe Kendale*** line makes me happy. Part admonishment, part genuine, part joke. It\'s just the thing to cap off a heart-to-heart: not to downplay the talk, but to ground it, and to confirm that what\'s good is still good \u2014 listen for a pat on the back.\\n\\n\\nDTH&GTG,\\n\\n\\n\u2013Matt\\n\\n\\nPS: Speaking of families that ain\'t a joke, here\'s me^ and mine.

(Deluxe Edition)","spotifyLink":"https://open.spotify.com/track/2Bv0qamiKGfDBtXCutmXJf","textBody":"4-13-2025: Just Be Simple\\n\\n\\n_____________________________\\n\\n\\nSong #339: \\"Just Be Simple\\"\\nWho Made it: Songs: Ohia\\nYear: 2003\\n_______________________________\\n\\n\\nThoughts: Timing with sad songs is hard. If I\'m down in a deep sense, I don\'t want to write about it: I can feel it or avoid it, but I can\'t muster perspective. One-liners follow. Conversely, if I feel great, I don\'t want to muddy it up with moans and groans. I\'d rather ride high.\\n\\n\\nThere\'s a sweet spot. Today\'s the right sort of day: recuperative. Not torn up, not in the clouds. I couldn\'t have managed it last night \u2014 too recently youthful, too recently active. But twelve hours past a bug is a good time to sit. My nerves have enough padding to handle Molina.\\n\\n\\nDisclaimer for those feeling frayed: this song is bitterly, potently sad. It goes beyond the usual devestations. I talked to Osman about some of the Ohia/Magnolia projects a few weeks ago, and he (fittingly) likened them to \\"Cognito-hazards\\":\\n\\n\\n image.png \\n\\n\\nThe hazard, here, is getting really down. I mean \\"eclipse\\". I mean \\"dementors\\". I mean \\"numb\\".\\nIt\'s a strong piece. Save it for a day that\'ll fit it.\\n\\n\\n*****************************\\n\\n\\nTime to complicate \'simple\'. A priori, not a bad thing. Many have done much with it. Consider the good: Prine\'s \\"Spanish Pipedream\\" makes the basics sound nice.\\n\\n\\nBlow up your TV\\nThrow away your paper\\nGo to the country\\nBuild you a home\\nPlant a little garden\\nEat a lot of peaches\\nTry an\' find Jesus on your own\\n\\n\\nLikewise for Ricky Skaggs\'* \\"A Simple Life\\".\\n\\n\\nI live a simple life\\nA good coat when the cold winds bite\\nLeather boots for my bare feet\\nNow and then a steak to eat\\nI pick with the boys on Friday night\\nSo I live a simple life.\\n\\n\\nI put those in the \\"happily simple\\" (simply happy?) bucket. There\'s a sense of being in on the secret, transcending the machine, folk wisdom, etc. etc. etc.. \\n\\n\\nTone down the contentment, though, and you get to \\"Simple Man\\"**:\\n\\n\\nOh, take your time, don\'t live too fast\\nTroubles will come and they will pass\\nYou\'ll find a woman, yeah, and you\'ll find love\\nAnd don\'t forget son there is someone up above\\n\\n\\nHere, if not contentment, there\'s hope: that focus on a few basic goods will ease an aching soul. It\'s less warm and folksy than Skaggs and Prine, more stoic and hopeful. It\'s still on the good side.\\n\\n\\nSeveral steps lower, we get to \\"JBS\\":\\n\\n\\nYou\'ll never hear me talk about\\nOne day getting out\\nWhy put a new address \\nOn the same old loneliness\\n\\n\\nThese words are not hopeful. \\"Despondent\\" fits. I don\'t take \\"simple\\" here to have anything to do with enlightenment. It\'s an anesthetic. When life hurts and you can\'t imagine improving it (by change of habit or address), you might just want less. \\n\\n\\n\\"Simple\\" cuts out the volume. It opts for a mild sub-neutral over wild, scathing swings. Hear how tired the last chorus is, how halting and dry. It\'s like the dead-eyed stare after a long cry, when you haven\'t cheered up but you\'ve worn yourself out. No gas to burn and no road to take.\\n\\n\\nIt\'s brutal.\\n\\n\\n*****************************\\n\\n\\nIf the sound weren\'t enough, here\'s what he says:\\n\\n\\nIt\'s always had that ghost \\nWho always almost tells me the secret\\nHow there\'s really no difference \\nIn who he was once\\nAnd who he\'s become\\n\\n\\nI think he\'s been letting me win\\nAnd I think he\'s doing it again\\nThanks for letting me win\\n\\n\\nAnd everything you hated me for\\nHoney there was so much more\\nI just didn\'t get busted\\n\\n\\nAwful things: to feel that you\'re (secretly) worse than anyone knows; that, even at your lowest, you\'ve gotten away with something; that the years have done no good \u2014 to quote Van Zandt, it\'s as \'low as low can be\'. \\n\\n\\nI try to end on a high note, but \\"JBS\\" makes it tough. I\'ll point to Molina\'s defiance, right before he winds down.\\n\\n\\nI ain\'t looking for that easy way out\\n\\n\\nA moment of strength amidst the downtroddence.\\n\\n\\n*****************************\\nGood news: this is the roughest song I can share.

You can read an account here (from someone who takes their research more seriously than I do) of how \\"M&W\\" came to be.\\nIn short: Emmylou didn\'t write it. I\'m not sure, actually, how it got to Harris, but Laurie Hyde Smith gets authorial credit. The article above is by a musician (Michaela Anne) who heard the song*, liked it, and tracked down its maker.\\n\\n\\nHere the two of them are:\\n\\n\\n MW_Writer.jpg \\n\\n\\n(Hyde Smith left, Anne right)\\n\\n\\n************************************\\nBy my reckoning, \\"M&W\\" is tragically overlooked. It\'s a bonus track on the 2003 remaster of Luxury Liner, which \u2014 frustratingly \u2014 means it\'s missing from my physical copy. The 2003 release date makes it our most chronologically advanced Harris track. You can hear the shift in her voice when she sings \'seven long years\', or \'never understood\', or \'plans we made\'.\\n\\n\\nHarris would\'ve been about 56 in \'03, with 40 years of touring and performing experience.** As should be obvious, that gives her delivery on \\"M&W\\" some punch. She\'s got plenty enough history to light up this verse:\\n\\n\\nMe and Willie, oh we watched a lot of dreams die young\\nPlans we made, how quick they fade, fumblin\' one by one\\nWillie never let it bother him and if he did, well it didn\'t show\\nYou know he had a way of lettin\' go, making blue turn gold\\n\\n\\nLess so than being \\"not Willie\\",  it\'s also \\"not Gram\\" \u2014 not just Gram.*** With how densely Harris cuts through this scene, you can assume she knew (and probably worked with) most of alt-country\'s \\"die-young dreamers\\" from \'67 to now. \\n\\n\\nThey\'re all in Willie.\\n\\n\\nFood for thought: How does it feel to sing about what might have been when it was what was?\\n\\n\\n\u2013Matt\\n\\n\\nPS: Unclear whether this is Marietta, Marietta, Marietta, Marietta, or Marietta.

It makes you wonder why. I\'ve done some digging on WIlliams over the course of the year, but never as much as I should have. So, I\'m flying (mostly) blind. But, I do know this: her dad \u2014 Miller Williams \u2014 was a poet. Not just just a hobbyist, either: he read at (fellow Arkansan) Bill Clinton\'s 1996 Inauguration.*\\n\\n\\n Screenshot 2025-04-21 191730.png \\n\\n\\n(Pictured here responding)\\n\\n\\nLW and MW were close. When Lucinda married her current husband (Tom Overby) in 2009 (onstage, mid performance, at First Avenue** in Minneapolis), Miller joined them to set the tone with a poem. He explains that he picked the one he did because it\'s about Lucinda, and because she (age seven) provided its last line (which you should read for yourself). He also shares a quote (spoken to him by a famous mentor) about poems, but that also works for songs: \\"Every good poem begins as the poet\'s and ends as the reader\'s\\".\\n\\n\\nYou can watch him recite here, and the rest of the vows here. ***\\n\\n\\n**********************************\\nMiller died in 2015 \u2014 New Year\'s Day. Toward the end, he fought Alzheimer\'s. Lucinda wrote \\"If My Love Could Kill\\" about it:\\n\\n\\nIf my love could kill\\nI would kill this\\nI would kill this\\nSlayer of wonders\\nSlayer of words\\nMurderer of poets\\nMurderer of songs\\nWho robbed me of your memory\\nWho robbed me of your time\\n\\n\\nBut before that, she (co)-wrote \\"Compassion\\",^ based off Miller\'s poem by the same name:\\n\\n\\nHave compassion for everyone you meet,\\neven if they don\u2019t want it. What seems conceit,\\nbad manners, or cynicism is always a sign\\nof things no ears have heard, no eyes have seen.\\nYou do not know what wars are going on\\n down there where the spirit meets the bone.\\n\\n\\nIf you\'re not afraid of tearing up, you should watch this video from Lucinda\'s Facebook page.

It\'s a rare one that I hear as sung to me (a.o.t. by me).

Enter \\"Catch and Release\\", a gem of a fishing ditty and therefore a gem of either an exaggeration or a substance (ab)use song. Billy, whose backstory could go to blows with River Shook and Johnny Cash as the platonic ideal of a country singer\'s upbringing, unsurprisingly springs for the latter. \\n\\n\\nFishermen are itinerant gamblers, depleting the hours with cast after cast, always swapping spots and changing lures in the hopes that this tweak, this new rabbit\'s foot, will change their luck and let them take the house for all it\'s worth. It\'s no surprise, then, that our hero doesn\'t mind rolling the dice with some grass behind the wheel: \\n\\n\\nSo we\'re crusin somewhere near Livingston\\nHad some herb in my bowl and I lit it again\\nI was jabbered in the jaw, and crimson in the eye\\nOn the way to Dale Hollow I was floatin like a butterfly\\nThen I got stung by a bee\\n\\n\\n\\"Jabbered in the jaw\\" is some fine alliterative onamonapia, and the stretching exhale of \\"floatin like a butterfly\\" balances the sharpness of \\"stung\\" nicely. This varying of pace does well for character development, too, as heard in poor Uncle Vinny\'s quick \\"wow\\"  and the more languid speech of Tennessee\'s finest, Officer Looper, who will absolutely be taking your grass and more than likely sneaking a few meows into the exchange. Yet just as quick as he set the hook, ol\' Looper\'s letting our hero slip back in the flow of the road, perhaps an eighth lighter but sure of his luck for the day. A pleasant circle; Billy is become bass. \\n\\n\\nI love the detail throughout, the world building that makes me feel like I\'m shotgun in a hotboxed hot rod of a pickup down below the Mason-Dixon. Calling out his Tracker, which is the Dickies of aluminum bass boats, sets the scene nicely. Name dropping the home of the world-record smallmouth sparks, for the more obsessive among us, that tantalizing feeling that today could be the day, could become the memory that sustains you through the winter. It\'s a glimmer of hope that is the essence of fishing, the day laid out untouched and brimming with possibility from your early morning vantage. \\n\\n\\nI saw Billy with my siblings and parents back in 2021. The set list was incredible, the show was on Jerry Garcia\'s birthday so the tie dye contingent was extra stoked and stoned, and as the opening chords of his cover of Riders on the Storm began to sink in the heavens opened to let down a deluge and the ghost of Ray Manzarek. It was still dumping when the show let out, the kind of rain that makes you squint to see your hand in front of your face and runs in sheets an inch deep over the pavement. There was disagreement about where we\'d left the car, so my brother, dad, and I exited confidently to the right while my mother and sister went left. They picked us up a few minutes later, having already availed themselves of the towels in the backseat.

Tickets were 20 bucks, owing to it just being Charlie at the merch table, on stage, and behind the scenes. His hair hovered in a halo round his head. There was a pronounced divot where he would anchor his right hand on the body of his guitar. He played \\"817 Oakland Avenue\\" first\u2014boy did that feel good. Can attest that his finger-flyin\' is as magical IRL as it is on FNL. He played \\"Over the Red Cedar\\" midset, at a slower tempo, emphasizing, as my friend Joe remarked, the people over the cedars with a quieter chorus. He regaled us with some dry banter, including a long story about thrift store pants from Fort Collins CO (The gist: thrift store in FC CO, found pants that fit perfectly, cashier said \'Bill\' had donated them, for years would return to same store when on tour and cashier would have set aside Bill\'s perfect-fitting garments, until one day he came and the cashier had some horrible news to share; pants have never fit since). He closed on a folk song about Casey Jones, which puts us on the right track for our headliner.\\n_____________________________\\n\\n\\nSong #355: \\"Look At Miss Ohio\\"\\nWho Made it: Gillian Welch\\nYear: 2003\\n_______________________________\\n\\n\\nThoughts: As a faithfully Catholic teenager, I\'d try to abstain from any varietal of sin, from the venial to the mortal (yes, I know you\'re all thinking sex, but that abnegation was simple enough for me to accomplish with minimal action on my part). But part of my encyclopedic knowledge of sinnage were the rules for wiping them from the record. All a Catholic has to do to right those wrongs is to confess your sins to a priest. As long you were truly contrite, forgiveness would come down as the dew. That\'d always be in the back of my mind\u2014that guaranteed absolution. Sin now, and be saved by my future self\'s change of heart.\\n\\n\\nThough no longer Catholic (though it seems no Catholic can truly claim the \'former\' title), its deep roots are one reason why I think Gillian\'s song has stuck with me.\\n\\n\\nYeah, I wanna do right but not right now\\n\\n\\nWhen I\'m sinning and I know it nowadays, sometimes I find myself muttering this line\u2014like a warped prayer. The paradox of a good person doing bad things. Or a bad person who thinks they\'re a good person doing bad things? Do bad things make us bad? ...do good things make us good? Or do we find ourselves caught up in that middle, ensnared in the ambiguity of our own circumstances, context, secret longings, histories, intentions, unintentions, woefully suspended in a soup of goodness and badness, a blameless web of moral unknowability? Or is a sin a sin, no matter which way you twist it?\\n\\n\\nLook at Miss Ohio. Broken heart(s); broken car(s); pregnancy, or lack thereof; drugs, crimes, words (un)spoken, on and on in the litany of our sins. We don\'t know what she did\u2014she sure does. I wanna do right but not right now. Spoken like this, who can blame a young woman\u2014boxed in by her overbearing mother and staid suitor\u2014for wanting, needing to sin some. Never left her county kind of gal. And yet the timbre of the line shifts, slides as G sings She says I wanna do right but not right now. From this vantage, her blameless anthem becomes an excuse. A promissory note with nothing backing it up. I\'m gonna straighten it out somehow\u2014like hell you will. Should have had it straightened out long time \'go. What\'d\'ya mamma say. Git\'n the damn car.\\n\\n\\nOh, Gillian, you\'ve given us in just six short stanzas, three of which are our chorus, a life and a quandary, and left the rest for us to fill in as we can and wish. Even more so than Wichita, Gillian does more story with less wording\u2014sonically as well. Rawlings steps back from his usual acrobatics here and only gives us only slight flourishes, leaving us with G\'s driving guitar, mournful dobro, soft bass, and, in that moment, the one that makes you lean in over the steering wheel or kick up the pace in your step a beat, the drumkit. I think I (totally unexperienced) could thump out that drumbeat, yet its presence is the hinge around which the song revolves.\\n\\n\\nAnd that first note\u2014the first voice we hear on the album as well. When first listening, I always had to turn down the volume some, and now I do it in anticipation of that first note. It\'s not its loudness. How it pierces! Feels like a surefired arrow right through the eardrum to the center of the head. Oh me oh my oh.\\n\\n\\nMatt\'s alluded on this list to something he proselytized when he first laid some Gillian on me: a Sunday morning Welch nap. Concept is what it is on the tin. I\'m ashamed to say I hadn\'t ever engaged in one\u2014until a few Sundays ago. My life is wonderfully full nowadays, so errant Sundays mornings are tough to catch. But there I was, home alone with a bit of time on my hands. I threw SJ (from the concert 7/23/24 in Burlington, VA) on my turntable and laid me down on my couch. G\'s clarion voice surrounded me as I lay adrift between sleepfulness and wakefulness. When I roused, I felt I had communed with myself and the music in some sort of new way I had not before.\\n\\n\\nI had been absolved of my sins in my modern confessional. In nomine Patris, et Filii, et Spritus Sancti. Amen.\\n\\n\\nSigning off,\\n\\n\\n\u2013Kevin\\n\\n\\nP.S.

We have wept with drunks and watched our loves walk away and come back and walk away again. Themes emerge from the darkling gloam: yearning for the road, dreaming of being able to dream, hoping for a hearth. Our lead author\'s restlessness is infectious. One can feel in the early entries a straining against the boundaries that describe his life. One feels now more peace. Reflection, not regret. The feeling of the last days of high school: I\'m done with this, but a fuzzy enjoyment persists. Pay attention to that theme. \\\\\\n\\n\\nThere were a dozen songs I thought of picking, but none had in them the magnificence necessary for what I was feeling. So.\\n\\n\\nA final bloviation on song production, and things to look out for as you listen.\\n\\n\\nMy final entry is Linda Ronstadt\'s masterful cover of Mohammed\'s Radio by America\'s greatest rockstar, Warren Zevon. Mohammed\'s Radio is an odd tune. Appears on Zevon\'s first album, which exists as a result of one of many favors his old pal Jackson Browne did him. Zevon\'s whole life seems to be people seeing something in him and trying to get him to get his shit together. One relates. \\n\\n\\nI have chosen Linda\'s version, because it has pedal steel. Mr. Radosevich told me that was a bare minimum requirement. The most Zevon version of this song, and one wholly unsuited to F+L, is the live one here. Linda\'s version is also far, far more technically polished, as well as less maximalist. A good match for this list, then. \\n\\n\\nThe song has no story behind it, just a bolt of inspiration while Zevon was hanging with the pre-fame Lidnsey Buckingham and Stevie Knicks, whom you can hear in the original album version providing some beautiful vocals. I\'m glad to know that it came out of nothing, it feels right for this song. Linda says she spent the requisite hours ingesting the song\'s meaning and metaphors to Rolling Stone. Hear her wail that \\"ALAS THEIR\\" after the gasoline and meat line. She knows what Zevon\'s about, for better or for worse. For proof positive of their friendship, listen to Zevon mutter on his live album of a different tune, \\"this song came along and intervened between me and starvation, thanks to Ms. Ronstadt\\".\\n\\n\\nAnd, god, the way she hits those final minute and thirty seconds puts all other versions to shame, starting with \\"you\'ve been up all night\\". Hear her hit the MIGHT JUST MIGHT JUST like a prayer. She fits in an extra might just, I\'m pretty sure. There\'s some beautiful, meaty licks from the piano, drums, guitar all at once to signify every new verse\'s beginning. Do listen carefully for what I believe is Waddy\'s understated pedal steel in your left ear here and there. Could be wrong, not my forte.\\n\\n\\nWhen I saw it on Zevon\'s album, I did a double take and clicked it immediately. I wondered if I could really ever claim, really own this song, from this old white right-winger. I wondered what he thought about Muslims. But then I realised.\\n\\n\\nHe is dead. Before he died it was his. Now, the song is mine as much as anyone\'s, like Mao and Jefferson. Onwards.\\n\\n\\nA song companion, in prose.\\n\\n\\nEverybody\'s restless and they got no place to go\\n\\n\\nFour years ago, I was on the phone with a sweetheart of mine and I saw an image in my mind\'s eye, clear as day. Me, burning like an asteroid. Ulysses came to mind. \\"Like a sinking star, beyond the utmost bound of human thought\\". I felt at that moment that my will to contest my place in the Occident would run dry. And that I\'d feel like a failure when it happened. \\n\\n\\nSomeone\'s always tryna tell them \\nSomethin\' they already know\\nSo their anger and resentment flow\\n\\n\\nBystanders were bemused, friends were confused. My constant struggle with leaving, staying, settling, running. It got to be exhausting to them. And to me, too.\\n\\n\\nYou know the sheriff\'s got his problems too\\nAnd he will surely take them out on me and you\\n\\n\\nToo many TSA goiter-fucks taking too many liberties. Too many half-translated thoughts left unspoken to make things move along easier. Too tired of being without power. Unrequited love is a sweet and necessary emotion in the young, but increasingly pathetic as one ages.\\n\\n\\nThere is a mysterious process that occurs in the human mind. By the time you\'re ready to accept an idea, it\'s like it\'s always been right there. It suddenly makes itself obvious. You walk towards an oasis in the desert. And the wind that\'s been rending you dies down to a cool breeze, and the sun gets covered up. The mirage shimmers give way to real water by the time you set foot in it. Suddenly walking away from something doesn\'t feel like giving up. It feels like gettin\' along.\\n\\n\\nThere I was at my brother\'s wedding a couple weeks back, looking around at the alien home I\'d left behind. I felt that time-to-be-gettin\'-along feeling. Like Radosevich smacking down on his thighs when the Trail Crew lunch had to come to an end, and the work needed to begin. I hadn\'t run dry. America had.\\n\\n\\nI felt that feeling again looking down at that Eight of Cups card in an old friend\'s Mughal-style house on the outskirts of town. I know it\'s nonsense. But I felt it.\\n\\n\\n image.png \\n\\n\\nBut how well off was I leaving my Americans? Those who wrought and sought and fought with me. Kind souls who took me in. I deserved it; in my very finest moments, I had done right by them, kept their lanterns lit. Where I found this hope to give I don\'t know. But find it I did. The prospects for world destruction that darkened my American friends\' brows lightened mine: a chance in this life for some stakes, a chance to make good with God. I had tried, really really tried to do right by them as they had done for me. And they\'d get along fine without me, like Stu saw. They\'ll grow all on their own. So will I.\\n\\n\\nIn walked the village idiot and his face was all aglow\\nHe\'d been up all night listening to Mohammed\'s Radio\\n\\n\\nA solemnity persists around leaving. That\'s okay, it should. But there\'s good reasons to leave. I write this at work. Here I sat, day after day, feeling my soul slip out of me while living demons vomited garbage onto our newspaper that would make Orwell blush. I sold my soul cheap in smiles and shrugs. I intend to buy it back in my blood.\\n\\n\\nEverybody\'s desperate, trying to make ends meet\\nWork all day, still can\'t pay the price of gasoline and meat\\nAlas, their lives are incomplete\\n\\n\\nKept away as I was from meaningful work by visas and imperial decline, the idea to leave for home took on a quality all its own. My mind wandered to more pressing labors, the family business. Schools and houses and food. The stuff of life. Babies and elders. Leave I must, sooner or later.\\n\\n\\nSo many of the F+L songs were about leaving, but not really. Being gone, but not forever. Loving the road, loving the home. Bringing back the melodies and rhythm you find. \\"I guess I look different too, because time changes everything\\". Wondering where the water comes from, wanting to follow it out. Taking people along in your pocket. \\n\\n\\nDon\'t it make you want to rock and roll\\nAll night long, Mohammed\'s Radio\\nI heard somebody singing sweet and soulful\\nOn the radio, Mohammed\'s Radio\\n\\n\\nIn a few hours I\'ll send this email off. Last night, my pal Vinny Costas told me he\'d take my spot in the apartment June 1st. Soon I\'ll talk to my boss and beg for a couple weeks off in the end of May so that I can squeeze the company for free money and visa-time before I leave. Then I\'ll call my mother. Then I\'ll ramble and rove for a bit, maybe up to New Hampshire, see the mountains I loved, then up to Toronto, maybe down to Texas to see our lead author. I\'ll go to the LBJ museum in Austin perhaps. I\'ll see Kevin, the first person I felt something like love for who wasn\'t my blood. Always wanted to see Big Sur. Maybe if there\'s time. I suppose there\'s always time. Maybe I\'ll go to Toronto and get a license first, work my way through America alone before exeunting.\\n\\n\\nAnd then, maybe sooner, maybe later, it\'ll be time to go home. No more working in tall buildings. Lahore hasn\'t built a skyscraper in years.\\n\\n\\nEight years ago, just as a shrimpy Pakistani boy was deciding on colleges, a user named Amosagain created an account to do one post on songmeanings.com, and then seemingly never posted again. It is attached below. This post is how I understand these past eight years: the baseline disrespect for the spirit, the patented American reality-blindness, and a certainty I have reading it that I\'d get along famously with the great white gammon who authored it. \\n\\n\\n Screenshot 2025-04-29 at 10.48.52 AM.png \\n\\n\\nWhat a stilly country you have here. What a lovely place to be young, to have been foolish, for wanting to do right, but not right now. \\"There\'s no missing it when you hear it, and no finding it if you are missing it.\\" A perfect line that could\'ve been in any of a hundred entries from this list. Direct contradiction of itself. Hope out of nothing, nothing without hope. Beautiful. To quote Ghalib, If I didn\'t exist, nothing would happen. If I didn\'t exist, nothing would happen. Get it?\\n\\n\\nI pray everyone reading this finds their way to the incredibly obvious things they can\'t yet acknowledge or describe as soon as possible. It\'s exciting, really. Don\'t you feel brave? And do enjoy the getting there, it\'s all you get to keep, as TVZ said.\\n\\n\\nI\'ll be gone, but not forever. And if you pay attention on the right night and you\'re tuned to the right frequency, you\'ll hear me out there, suffrin\' and runnin\' and laughin\' like mad. Spreading the light you put in my breast pocket in a far corner of the world. Be watchful for it.\\n\\n\\nYou\'ve been up all night listening for his drum\\nHoping that the righteous might just might just might just might just come\\nI heard the General whisper to his aide-de-camp\\n\\"Be watchful for Mohammed\'s lamp\\"\\n\\n\\nDon\'t it make you want to rock and roll\\nAll night long\\nMohammed\'s Radio\\n\\n\\n-ORK\\n\\n\\nNote, Mohammed in these lyrics here is a regular fellow who shares the Prophet (Peace Be Upon Him)\'s name.

Greedily,  I wanted this one for myself. It feels right, though, that this should follow close on the heels of KD\'s finale: \\"Ohio\\" opens Soul Journey, and \\"Wrecking\\" ends it** \u2014\\nnot quite a hit, not quite a deepcut, but a definite favorite among Welch heads.\\n\\n\\nIt\'s a song that you take as your anthem.\\n\\n\\n************************\\nWe\'ve left the Welch we\'ve known. Where \\"Revelator\\" did its deeds with wood strums and voice, \\"Wrecking\\" layers in bass, drums, fiddle, electric organ, no less than two guitars, and stronger than usual lung-clenching vocals. This comes into best effect at  2:44 and 3:21\u2014 post \'canteen\' and post \'nothing at all\' \u2014 when the pedaled-up guitar lets loose. The song gets to be something like a famous wave or a mean bull: she risks a pummelling, a drowning by noise, but stays on top for glory.\\n\\n\\nThis is not GW+DR\'s first loud song (compare, for example, \\"Pass You By\\" on Revival). But, it\'s a departure, and the first major electrification on Soul Journey \u2014 Gillian\'s own Iscariotic moment, her Welch-a-la-Newport.\\n\\n\\n************************\\nPreviously, I\'ve mentioned Welch\'s near-alien, demi-goddish talents. We get those on \\"Wrecking\\", but with a twist \u2014 the prophet speaks her own mythos. Through her pen, a few wayward years*** feel like a string of resurrections, a nearly complete nirvanic path. It\'s bold and sure, harder-won than not. It\'s the conviction of youth with a few years behind it:\\n\\n\\nLook out, boys, I\'m a rollin\' stone\\nThat\'s what I was when I first left home\\nI took every secret that I\'d ever known\\nAnd headed for the wall\\nLike a wrecking ball\\n\\n\\nThis, to me, sounds like a song from the road. I don\'t mean that for the obvious reasons (the \'rolling\' or the \'leaving home\'). I mean it because it reminds me of a feeling that I\'ve mostly only had on my way between places: feeling the scope of my life.\\n\\n\\nDriving is great for this. Moving is also good for this, after the hubbub. The grand moments \u2014 the graduations themselves, the first days on the clock \u2014 never give you this feeling. You act like they do because you think that they should, and we all go along with it. We cheer and snap pictures and take ourselves to dinner. But the feeling comes later, delayed in proportion to significance.\\n\\n\\nThey tell you that something is over. You assume that it\'s true and you make your next plans. You try the right motions and work toward direction. Then, hours or weeks or years later, you go along and get it:\\n\\n\\nThe days were rough and it\'s all quite dim\\nBut my mind cuts through it all\\nLike a wrecking ball\\n\\n\\nThus spake Gillian. Snarled, stacked layers, peeled and revealed, promised and unseen. Years of ramification, indexed by old habits and new contexts. \\nEvery so often, we see right through.\\n************************ \\n\\n\\n\\"Wrecking Ball\\" comes with a memory. This was Summer \'21. I had one year of teaching under my belt, and an itch for manual labor. I\'d signed on for a third season of trailwork, led by KD himself. I joined the crew late but as soon as I could. The RAV took me from Maine to Holt\'s Ledge (specifically, this little strip), where I savored a last minute of rest before chugging up the trail.\\n\\n\\nGillian sang the anthem.\\n\\n\\nLater that summer, I finished. I have a feeling that I might have used this story before, but I couldn\'t find it in the (woefully outdated) archive. Anyway, it was my last day with the crew. I\'d leave in the morning to go back to Maine, go back to teaching. We were on Holt\'s Ledge again, winding down. I was on crush duty, John-Henry-ing away at a pile of rocks for staircase backfill. The rest of the crew was packing up, but I dawdled.\\n\\n\\nKevin came down to get me. He gave a gentle, diplomatic indication that the rest of the crew was ready to leave. I gruffed something back about the importance of finishing the step, or the foolishness of leaving rocks unsmashed, and bought myself a minute. \\n\\n\\nThat\'s when I cracked. I knew it was time to go, and that I couldn\'t come back; that this was my \\"bonus round\\"; that something I loved was gone for good as soon as I stopped swinging.\\n\\n\\nA \'blinding ache\' indeed.\\n\\n\\nI indulged a last swing, (partially) gathered myself, and walked up to drop my hammer in the cache. I muttered to Kevin (\\"It\'s a sad day when a cowboy hangs up his spurs\\"), lost myself again, then tromped off to save face.\\n\\n\\nThis was the view as I went:\\n\\n\\n Screenshot_20250501_154807_Photos.jpg \\n\\n\\n************************\\n\\n\\nYou can feel loss in the moment, but hardly ever the pride of growth. That comes later, after the dust clears and shouts pipe down. You need space in its many, varied meanings to get a view of yourself. And by its nature, it can\'t happen often. It\'s unsustainable: the mind can\'t hold a whole life at once. On any given day, we fuzz out most of what we\'ve done and who we\'ve been. When we remember \u2014 remember in feeling and belief, past mere recall \u2014 we amaze ourselves.\\n\\n\\nIt ought to be propulsive.\\n\\n\\n\u2013Matt\\n\\n\\nPS1: Back in October, I mentioned the Cardinals at the Window charity compilation. I bought it, and urged y\'all to do the same. If you didn\'t, though, I think enough time has passed that it\'s okay for me to \\"privately share\\" the file of Waxahatchee\'s \\"Wrecking Ball\\" cover (with MJL on drums/backing vocals). See attached.\\n\\n\\nPS2: Another Gillian Welch song that might\'ve had a place this year is \\"I Dream a Highway\\". It\'s a 15 minute epic, replete with biblical allusions and alt-country folk-legend. KD and I talked about tag-teaming it, but the days got away.^ Here\'s a taste:\\n\\n\\nWhich lover are you, Jack of diamonds?\\nNow you be Emmylou and I\'ll be Gram\\nI\'ll send a letter, don\'t know who I am\\nI dream a highway back to you\\n\\n\\nI\'m an undisguisable shade of twilight\\nAny second now, I\'m gonna turn myself on\\nIn the blue display of the cool cathode ray\\nI dream a highway back to you\\n\\n\\nPrime fodder for a woozy Welch nap.\\n\\n\\nPS3: Can\'t talk about Summer \'21 without sharing the only picture that makes me look stronger than Frank:\\n\\n\\n Screenshot_20250501_154601_Photos.jpg \\n\\n\\nVeins don\'t pop like that in my 9-to-5.\\n\\n\\n*Don\'t remember if I ever followed up, but recall the Spotify Wrapped sweepstakes from F&L #209 (scoring points in descending value for every F&L song on your 2024 top 100).

Primarily, there\'s Big Bluegrass Breakfast \u2014 my crowdsourced, AM-acoustic appreciation page, which has gone on hold this year but will make a comeback.\\n\\n\\nSecondarily, there\'s Stair Master Perennial. SMP was a project from my good friend/ex-colleague/ex-roommate Andrew Burroughs,** which entailed getting folks to curate short playlists and write blurbs about them. I made one called \\"Storm In The Valley\\", with this as accompaniment:\\n\\n\\nI grew up with thunderstorms in the Laramie Valley. They came on summer afternoons, raged, flooded, and moved on in a moment. That weather pattern lodged itself in my moods. Bouts of melancholy rumble down and drive me to shelter. Then, they pass. This playlist fits those times. Banjos and mandolins string together songs that circle around a twangy sort of sadness. Put it on the next time you\'re feeling cloudy. Lean in, listen up, and ride it out.\\n\\n\\nClearly, there\'s some sentimental overlap. Just about every song on \\"SITV\\" has made its way into an F&L feature or link, including \\"WWW\\".\\n\\n\\n*****************\\nWe\'re due for a loud one. Your mental map should put \\"WWW\\" right next to \\"Zip City\\" (#5), which was our first heavy hit (unless you count #2).\\n\\n\\n image.png \\n\\n\\nLast call for Truckers. W.r.t. listening instructions, I\'ll steal a quote from the Dirty South liner notes, which matches what I said for \\"Zip\\":\\n\\n\\n Screenshot 2025-05-03 223947.png \\n\\n\\n\\"Whiskey\\" comes on hard \u2014 no pause between \\"play\\" and the three big chords. I remember groggily listening to Southern Rock Opera in the wee hours of a pre-travel all-nighter in college and snapping to attention when this track landed. I used \\"WWW\\" on my SMP list for shock value after Gillian\'s restrained \\"EPB\\" and to cut the sweetness of \\"WYCBD\\". \\n\\n\\nIt knocks the dust off the rafters.\\n*****************\\n\\n\\nLyrically, we know to pause on \'I think\' and \'I guess\'. We return to the \\"Cooley-zone\\"*** between humor, despair, and heartfelt pith:\\n\\n\\nWhen I\'m six feet underground, I\'ll need a drink or two\\nAnd I\'ll sure miss you\\nWe get a \'could\' verse too:\\n\\n\\nThe highway\'s humming in my head and it\'s all I hear\\nCould you read my lips if I pulled you near enough\\nCould you read my fortune in the bottom of this coffee cup\\nCan you tell me how to tell when I\'ve had enough?\\n\\n\\nBegs the question: can anyone?\\n\\n\\n*****************\\n\\n\\nTo no surprise^, I\'ll point out that Wednesday does a cover.

Mark the occasion with a picture of him in funny glasses, which was the flier for his first art show.\\n\\n\\n TA_Flyer.jpg \\n\\n\\nThe man\'s been on my mind. His birthday\'s coming up on Wednesday \u2014 82 years. He\'s still performing \u2014 still healthy, as far as I know. I flipped through his bio this morning, checking the dog-ears for sparks. This bit stood out from his days as a young father and not-yet-successful artist:\\n\\n\\nEvery day, While Jo Harvey wrangled the kids . . . Terry, a Lubbock Bartleby, morosely partook in a daily ritual of sloth and existential resistance. In the morning hours, he sat on their lone couch, sullen and silent, with a notebook on his lap, chainsmoking, and watched the Newlywed Game . . . \\n\\n\\n[quote Terry] \\"Jo Harvey\'s mother thought this was pure lowlife behavior, which I suppose it was.\\"\\n\\n\\nI\'ve felt sort of lowlife-ish myself today, floating through the strange limbo at the end of the school year. I don\'t have finals or quals or anything like that to worry about. My advisor\'s away in Switzerland. Moving ate up last week; my folks are visiting on Thursday; and I\'ve got five last emails to wrangle together.\\n\\n\\nIt\'s the \\"uncanny valley\\" of leisure: much to do (including work), but diffusely, and with no urgency (yet).\\n\\n\\nThe image of Terry, \\"working\\" in his notebook and plopped on the couch, hit home. I\'ve often sat down to write an email, gone to YouTube for a concert video, then fallen off course with shorts and skits. Maybe I\'ll lie to myself less once the week is through and I can\'t mask my scrolling as \\"existential resistance.\\"\\n\\n\\nNot that my efforts or aspirations match Allen\'s, but it\'s nice to know that he turned out alright.*\\n\\n\\n**************************\\n\\n\\nI owe everyone some biographical fill-ins. Guy Clark won\'t have another song this year, but we can send him off with some help from a friend. Recall (#28, #70) that Terry and Guy were close: close enough for Clark to ask Allen to work his earthly remains into a statue.\\n\\n\\nThe abiding joke between Clark and Allen . . . was that Allen would cast a bronze goat and install Clark\'s remains in its rear. After Guy\'s death on May 17, 2016, Terry, faced with the reality of his friend\'s request for his earthly form to be incorporated into a sculpture, reconsidered.\\n\\n\\nRather than un cul du bouc, Allen put Clark\'s ashes into a crow \u2014 a bird Clark loved at the end of his life.\\n\\n\\n CCB.jpg \\n\\n\\nThe piece is called Caw Caw Blues. It shares its name with a song that Rodney Crowell** wrote with Clark in his last months.***\\n\\n\\nYou can hear Rod tell the story here.\\n\\n\\n**************************\\n\\n\\nVan Zandt still has another song. Still, I\'ll take this chance to borrow more from Terry\'s bio, and to share a fine goodbye:\\n\\n\\nThe next day,^ Guy called [Terry] to tell him that Townes Van Zandt had also died. Terry had played a show with Townes only two months earlier. At nine the next morning, Van Zandt appeared with a half-full wine bottle in hand, grinning and wearing \\"goofy mocassins.\\" Terry embraced him and bid him what proved an appositely poetic final farewell:\\n\\n\\n\\"See you when the wind blows.\\"\\n\\n\\n************************** \\nAnd a fitting quote:\\n\\n\\n\\"Now that John Hartford, Guy and Townes are gone, Terry\'s the last of my teachers.\\"\\n\\n\\n\u2013Steve Earle\\n_____________________________\\n\\n\\nSong #361: \\"The Wolfman of Del Rio\\"\\nWho Made it: Terry Allen\\nYear: 1979\\n_______________________________\\n\\n\\nThoughts: Foot stomp percussion. Arrhythmic piano. Lusty undertones.\\nAll the trappings of an Allen classic.\\n\\n\\n\\"Wolfman\\" is my favorite from Lubbock. It\'s wonderful in the strong sense: not just nice sounding, but vision rousing. It\'s a quieter, more cosmic counterpart to \\"Zip City\\" (#5):\\n\\n\\nAnd you can tell by the look on his face\\nHe\'s all caught up with a need\\nTo trade in some emptied out spaces\\nFor some speed\\nAnd that good old American dream\\n\\n\\nThe gentleness of the chorus (up to \'speed\'^^) reminds me of nighttime whispers: not to hide your voice, but to respect your instincts. It sounds like stargazing and sci-fi, like secret crushes and rearview ghosts.\\n\\n\\nThe \\"young\\" dreamers find Welch-ish permanence in their sub-nostalgic dance:\\n\\n\\nAnd now they circle one another\\nArmed with the lives from their past\\nAnd they fight to the death for their lies\\nUntil the bad feelings pass\\nThen they sit, and they smoke\\nAnd they drink, and they talk and talk\\nAnd talk and talk, and then they stalk around\\nLike they\'re looking for something they\'ve lost\\nThat can never again be found\\n\\n\\nAllen takes firstness and lastness, then \u2014 rightfully \u2014 mashes them together past distinction. The asphalt-um line\'s been compactified, projectivized, and made to loop, but still drives the same.\\n\\n\\n************************** \\nReturning to feelings of lowlife-ishness. Part of something bigger:\\n\\n\\nIt most certainly seems some disease of the dreams\\nHad been going \'round\\n\\n\\nAnyway, I feel better now.\\n\\n\\nW.r.t. disease: Terry\'s no cure, but he ain\'t far off.\\n\\n\\n\u2013Matt\\n\\n\\nPS1: This is the Wolfman.\\n\\n\\nPS2: There\'s a print to go with it.\\n\\n\\n Wolfman.jpg \\n\\n\\nPS3: I had my own teenaged \'hundred miles an hour\' moment. It was in 2015 on Roger\'s Canyon road with (a very angry) LJT.\\n\\n\\nNo Wolfman, but \\"Work REMIX\\" was probably playing.\\n\\n\\nPS4: Watch this.\\n\\n\\n*More to be done in unpacking the fear/admiration pairing in my head w.r.t. \\"noble loafers\\".

I can\'t remember how I heard it the first time; now, every time, I\'m waiting for the chorus, waiting to get hit. It\'s the sort of not-yet-loudness that kills at concerts (like \\"At Least That\'s What You Said\\" did on Sunday, or \\"You Are My Face\\" could have).\\n\\n\\nThis is the take-away line:\\n\\n\\nNot forever, just for now\\nNot forever, but just for now***\\n\\n\\nIn context, it\'s about temporary promotion of vice over salvation  \u2014 see #355 and \'not right now\'.

LRG seems like a real character. His first band was called \\"Human Sexual Respone\\", which grew from an all-kazoo band (\\"Kazoondheit\\"). Later, he formed \\"a country trio with a drum machine\\" called \\"The Blackstone Valley Sinners\\", which had some weird stuff.\\n\\n\\nIf you want to hire him, you can do it for $75.\\n\\n\\n Screenshot 2025-05-06 150025.png \\n\\n\\n**Dare I say turnstyled, junkpiled, and railroaded, too?\\n*** Not Forever, Just For Now was the title of one of Tupelo\'s early tapes.\\n\\n\\n UT-Demo_Front.jpg \\n\\n\\nDemo versions of \\"Flatness\\" and \\"Whiskey Bottle\\" (which were back to back on NF,JFN) are attached for your inspection \u2014 \\"Flatness\\" sounds particularly spooky.\\n\\n\\n^And whether a \'must be\' can be its own \'something to believe\'.\\n\\n\\n^^An attendee of last night\'s MJL show in Burlington informed me that Xandy Chelmis had been replaced by \\"carrot top on pedal steel\\", aka Trevor Nikrant.

Time for home-stretchin\'.\\n\\n\\nWe can start with a shameful story \u2014 something to get off the chest. Back in my junior high years, I liked The Fray. That\'s not such a bad thing in and of itself, but here\'s the fraught part: I heard their cover* of \\"Boulder to Birmingham\\" before I heard Emmylou\'s original.\\n\\n\\nWorse: when I heard the cover, I wondered who the old lady with the weird voice was. I wondered why they brought her onboard, and why she deserved the feature.\\n\\n\\nMy apologies to all involved. Consider this, among other things, a year of penance.\\n\\n\\nNot sharing the story to bash The Fray, but to bash my ignorant palate, and to prove a point. It took some time before I fell for Emmylou. So if any of y\'all out there don\'t share my love, hope\'s not lost. You can still come around.\\n_____________________________\\n\\n\\nSong #363: \\"Boulder to Birmingham\\"\\nWho Made it: Emmylou Harris\\nYear: 1975\\n_______________________________\\n\\n\\nThoughts: Another source of editorial shame: this is Emmylou\'s first track this year that she wrote herself \u2014 entirely my fault. She\'s got plenty of originals, and deserves as much attention for her songwriting as for her performing. But, like Ronstandt, most of her early albums saw her recording others\' material, and those are the albums I know best. Soon, I\'m going to give some thorough attention to the second half of her career, maybe starting with Red Dirt Girl \u2014 a known masterpiece.**\\n\\n\\nAs before: \'please don\'t confront me with my failures. I\'m aware of them.\'\\n\\n\\nMoving on: \\"BtoB\\" is gold. Let\'s not overlook the brashness of starting a heart-wrenching, throat-clenching, chest-smack tune with \'I don\'t want to hear a love song\' and \'I don\'t want to hear a sad story\'.\\n\\n\\nWe\'re gonna hear it anyway \u2014 don\'t get to pick when those come your way.\\n\\n\\n*********************\\nI think about the I-95 part pretty often:\\n\\n\\nWell, you really got me this time\\nAnd the hardest part is knowing I\'ll survive\\nAnd I come to listen for the sound\\nOf the trucks as they move down out on 95\\nAnd pretend that it\'s the ocean\\nComing down to wash me clean\\nTo wash me clean\\nBaby, do you know what I mean?\\n\\n\\nl can\'t hear \'95\' these days, but I\'ve got my pick of highways. And like with \\"A Rolling Stone\\" or \\"Fare Thee Well\\", I probably don\'t know what she means \u2014 at least not all of it. But I ask myself every time she asks it, I believe that she knows, and I learn my little lessons.\\n\\n\\nSuch as: you can do a lot of things when you miss someone(s). You can walk a long ways, or write a bunch of words. You can fixate, distract, review and avoid. You can pine and plead.\\n\\n\\nIn the end, you get a lot from getting by.\\n\\n\\nKnow what I mean?\\n\\n\\n\u2013Matt\\n\\n\\nPS1: Today\'s tear-jerker is a YouTube algo classic: this video of First Aid Kit performing \\"Emmylou\\" for a choked up Harris.

Acquaintances hearing nine minute long experimental country tracks, thinking of me, then getting them sent my way is the exact sort of karmic repayment that I think I\'ve earned at this point \u2014 good out, good in.\\n\\n\\nHere\'s the song and some lines that stood out to me:\\n\\n\\nNow it\'s a pissin\' competition\\nBetween the man I am and the guy I was\\nAnd your sweet nothings are still souring sheets on the bed\\nAnd the threads of my clothes\\nAs I lie entrenched in my own ignorance\\nAnd drenched\\nFrom my head to my toes\\n\\n\\nGreat stuff.

Houston did its best to cut the list short by setting a severe thunderstorm on me during my bike ride home. Flash-bang thunder, blow-down wind, standing water \u2014 the works. Don\'t tell Dan and Julie, but I almost got smacked (inches of separation) by some numb-nut double-dipping the four-way at Woodhead and Welch. I fish-tailed, took the lord\'s name, then recovered and continued.\\n\\nI will not be denied: unless the night smites me, we\'ll have our last song.\\n\\n*Worth a click for anyone who likes Zevon, cowbell, or fitting loads of people on a stage.\\n\\n**After I made it home and stripped off my wet stuff, I found a large insectoid invader \u2014 not much risk of injury, but significant insult to spirit.
