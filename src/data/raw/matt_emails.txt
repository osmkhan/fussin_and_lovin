 Continuing the plan for the week. This is late career Van Zandt.

Song #276: "Lover's Lullaby"


Who Made it: Townes Van Zandt

Year: 1994

_______________________________

Thoughts: I'll acknowledge that this recording of "Lover's Lullaby" might
not appeal to the acousti-purists out there. It took time to grow on me, so
give it a few chances. If you can't get over the heightened production,
though, you have options. There's the spare rendition

on *The Highway Kind *(the first posthumous album), and this
jaw-dropping/heart-breaking live video
.


Everyone should watch the video. If you're busy, watch it instead of
clicking the list pick. My main gripe with "LL" on *No Deeper Blue *is that
it sounds artificially strong, like a de-aged Harrison Ford. The reverb and
layers mask the cracks in Van Zandt's voice — it's believable, but only if
you don't know better. The real thing comes through a few times (like the
first '*there*' at 0:40), which gives the song its life.


In the video, "life" is clearer. More cracks, more swallows. The weakening
strengthens it. Van Zandt starts by saying "I've written a few love songs,
and this might be the prettiest," which is hard to disagree with. So by the
end, when he wipes his eye, you might do the same.


Is this our only lullaby? Probably, unless you count "WTWGIS" (#69) or
"AMOT" (#222). With any luck it'll work, and you'll rest with kind wishes:


*Sleep babe, till the moon slips away*




*I'm hopin' all you're dreamin' comes trueWhen you rise with the dayI might
not have too much to sayBut you know that doesn't mean that I don't love
youOh, you know that doesn't mean that I don't love you*


Again, the video's more convincing, especially with the last bit. Catch the
choke at 2:30, which drives it home  — the things you mean aren't easy.

Song #272: "Honey I Been Thinking About You"


Who Made it: Jackie Greene

Year: 2005

_______________________________

Thoughts: Jack G. (contributor/subscriber, not today's musician) tipped me
off about the backstory of "Honey". Hear Jackie G. (today's musician, not

Song #294: "Sounds Better in the Song"


Who Made it: Drive-By Truckers

Year: 2003

_______________________________

Thoughts: Going pretty far to the "F" side with this one. I listened to it
most back in May of 2020, when things were not ideal.* I don't bust it out
much these days, but it's good to keep around. You can do the same.


DBT keep lyrics to their songs on their website
. There's also
usually some analysis from the songwriter: stories, interpretations,
context, etc. That's been a good resource for me on prior write-ups. For
"Sounds Better", there's just a line from the song:


[image: image.png]

We can assume that Mike was hurting.

You know this by now, but I'll say again that Skynyrd was an influence. The
"song" in question is "Free Bird"
:

*Well the drifter he holds on to his youth*

*Just like it was money in the bank And "Lord knows, I can't change"
*

*Sounds better in the song Than it does with hell to pay*

Part of the angst underlying my binge-listening of "Sounds Better"  had to
do with my own dashed dreams of (relative) rockstardom — any reminder of
guitar solos got me worked up. That's not the main thing, though, that
makes this song sting. This verse is worse:




*Dreams are given to you when you're young enough to dream them Before they
can do you any harmThey don't start to hurt until you try to hold on to
them *



*After seeing what they really are She used to dream them with me, every
single crazy oneUntil they started hurting her too, now she's got some of
her own And outgrowing me, might be the best thing for her she's ever done*


Now's a good time to recall Springsteen's "River"
,
and to sit with unimportance, goodwill, and growth.

Song #304: "Houses"


Who Made it: Elyse Weinberg

Year: 1969

_______________________________

Thoughts: Digging myself out from under a pile of grading at the moment, so
it's gonna have to be a short one. Busy few days might entail a couple more
punts, but I aim to write in earnest next week. We'll see.


This one's folky, with a twist of static.


Some trivia for the Springsteen contingent: young Nils Lofgren (eighteen at
the time of recording) plays guitar on the album (*Greasepaint Smile*).

Song #344: "Cantina Carlotta"


Who Made it: Terry Allen

Year: 1975

_______________________________

Thoughts: Voiceover is jarring on shuffle.


If you go deep into the *Juarez* lore, the Carlotta character is a sort of
time-travel-coded reconsciousing — more at hand than a name change.


'*Affectionada*' is not a word in any language, but does work well with
rhymes.

Song #303: "Love Has No Pride"


Who Made it: Linda Ronstadt

Year: 1973

_______________________________

Thoughts: There's some meanness in naming your album *Don't Cry Now *then
putting songs* like this on it. "LHNP" might've been a better fit (w.r.t.
album title) for Ronstadt's *Cry Like a Rainstorm Howl Like the Wind*,
which came out sixteen years after the fact — too late by far.


Anyway, it's tailor-made for the nadir of a rom-com: on-the-outs, plane
taking off, near-miss missed, etc. Use it in need, but don't take it to
heart. The first verse is the toughest:






*I've had bad dreams too many times, To think that they don't mean much any
more. Fine times have gone and left my sad home, Friends who once cared
just walk out my door. *

Makes me wonder if believing in your bad dreams makes you trust the good
ones too, or if they're separate issues.

Lyrical subtlety: the last time around, she sings '*when there's no one but
myself to blame*' instead of '*when there's no one left to blame*', which
makes it 10x harder to swallow.

Bonus video for the dry-eyed holdouts here
. The reworked ending is
killer.


–Matt


*And her version of "Desperado"
**,
and her version of "Colorado"
.


**Obligatory to get torn up by this one once every few years.


PS: Wednesday (F&L #129, Lenderman involved) have a song

of the same name, but with "(condemned)" added at the end — pretty pointed.

Song #350: "Catch and Release"


Who Made it: Billy Strings

Year: 2024

_______________________________

Thoughts: I couldn't let the alt-country calendar elapse with neither Billy
nor a fishing song* on the list. Enter "Catch and Release", a gem of a
fishing ditty and therefore a gem of either an exaggeration or a substance
(ab)use song. Billy, whose backstory could go to blows with River Shook and
Johnny Cash as the platonic ideal of a country singer's upbringing,
unsurprisingly springs for the latter.

Fishermen are itinerant gamblers, depleting the hours with cast after cast,
always swapping spots and changing lures in the hopes that this tweak, this
new rabbit's foot, will change their luck and let them take the house for
all it's worth. It's no surprise, then, that our hero doesn't mind rolling
the dice with some grass behind the wheel:

*So we're crusin somewhere near Livingston*
*Had some herb in my bowl and I lit it again*
*I was jabbered in the jaw, and crimson in the eye*
*On the way to Dale Hollow I was floatin like a butterfly*
*Then I got stung by a bee*

"Jabbered in the jaw" is some fine alliterative onamonapia, and the
stretching exhale of "floatin like a butterfly" balances the sharpness of
"stung" nicely. This varying of pace does well for character development,
too, as heard in poor Uncle Vinny's quick "wow"  and the more languid
speech of Tennessee's finest, Officer Looper, who will absolutely be taking
your grass and more than likely sneaking a few meows
 into the exchange. Yet
just as quick as he set the hook, ol' Looper's letting our hero slip back
in the flow of the road, perhaps an eighth lighter but sure of his luck for
the day. A pleasant circle; Billy is become
 bass.

I love the detail throughout, the world building that makes me feel like
I'm shotgun in a hotboxed hot rod of a pickup down below the Mason-Dixon.
Calling out his Tracker, which is the Dickies of aluminum bass boats, sets
the scene nicely. Name dropping the home 
of the world-record smallmouth sparks, for the more obsessive among us,
that tantalizing feeling that today could be the day, could become the
memory that sustains you through the winter. It's a glimmer of hope that is
the essence of fishing, the day laid out untouched and brimming with
possibility from your early morning vantage.

I saw Billy with my siblings and parents back in 2021. The set list

was incredible, the show was on Jerry Garcia's birthday so the tie dye
contingent was extra stoked and stoned, and as the opening chords of his
cover of Riders on the Storm began to sink in the heavens opened to let
down a deluge and the ghost of Ray Manzarek. It was still dumping when the
show let out, the kind of rain that makes you squint to see your hand in
front of your face and runs in sheets an inch deep over the pavement. There
was disagreement about where we'd left the car, so my brother, dad, and I
exited confidently to the right while my mother and sister went left. They
picked us up a few minutes later, having already availed themselves of the
towels in the backseat. Ain't that fishing: win some lose some.

Tight lines,

–Jack

Song #288: "Friends Like Those"


Who Made it: Robert Ellis

Year: 2011

_______________________________

Thoughts: Approaching the 300 song mark. There's enough "hay in the barn"
now to see where there've been gaps. Some might be "genre" issues, and
others personal. I see "songs about friends" as one thematic thin spot, so
here's a song to help it.

It's a song that makes you think, "dang, that's true". This verse in
particular:





*Some of my best friendsThey already have childrenThey got lives with
womenWomen I've never met*





*Their kids probably wouldn'tKnow me from chocolate puddin'But I guess it's
just the sameI don't think it changes a thing*


It reminds me of picking up a high-school friend for a ski when I was home
a few years ago. The friend got married back in 2018, and has some kids
now. Contributor LJ and I popped in to meet the next generation. As I
remember, they weren't too glad to see their "uncles" — probably would have
preferred the *puddin'*. We stuck around for a few minutes, had a good ski,
then dropped him back off.


It was strange and hopeful: that my friend had *kids*, and that *my friend *had
kids. The youngsters lucked out — couldn't much hope for a better dad than
him.* We haven't talked in a while, but I bet he would if I asked.

Who Made it: Kenny Rogers

Thoughts: Little bit of a mixup with the V-day countdown. When I made the
lineup back in May, I planned to start the sequence on Sunday 2-9. I didn't
have my calendar with me this weekend, though, so I jumped the gun with DBT
on Saturday.


That leaves me one love-song short. Enter Kenny Rogers.


A change of pace from "Long Long Time": "LWTYA" is fun. It believes in
itself. It's momentous (in the sense of bearing momentum) and sweet (in the
sentimental sense).


Most importantly, it's a standout track on the *Eastbound and Down*
soundtrack, which is
where I first heard it — more proof of McBride's good taste.*

Song #315: "Further On Up The Road"


Who Made it: Johnny Cash

Year: 2006

_______________________________

Thoughts: I’m walking in deep footsteps after yesterday’s magnum opus. I
hope everyone enjoyed it as much as I did. I follow with my own pair of
stars: the Man In Black and the Boss.



Although Johnny had covered Bruce a time

or two
,
this one is different. It’s deeper cut

from
Bruce’s later work, a decidedly non-country rocker, and IMHO lacking in its
execution. But with a new countrified arrangement and the gravelly voice of
age, Johnny *absolutely nailed it*. But why? Why this song, of all songs?



Recorded

 in the summer of 2003, nearly blind and wheelchair bound, Cash had just
weeks left to live. His wife had just passed away in May, and without June,
Cash had only music left to live for. Recording when he had the strength,
he and producer Rick Rubin* created enough material for two posthumous
albums. For the sake of the song.



This is what makes Johnny’s “Further On Up The Road” so powerful: the voice
of a man who had lost what was most dear to him, staring his own death in
the face. He had no other option but to persist, create music, and hold his
head high.



*I got a song to sing, to keep me out of the cold*

*I’ll meet you further on up the road*



This song got a lot of listens, by me, in the spring of 2020. I felt like I
was living in the third verse: out in the desert, looking for a sign. I had
a fever burning in my soul. It gave me the idea that there was more than
hope, but inevitability, of better times ahead. I think it gave Cash the
same idea.



*One sunny morning we’ll rise I know*

*And I’ll meet you further on up the road*


***A prolific producer, but the only FnL universe web strand I can find is
that he produced for the Chicks, whose member Natalie Maines, is, as we
know, the daughter of our pedal steel hero Lloyd Maines.

 Sleepy afternoon. Roommate's out of town, so I'm enjoying uninterrupted
time in the rarely used living room. I spun some Kristofferson earlier,
baked some tofu, and cracked a couple Shiners. It's chilly enough outside
to feel good, but not chilly enough to run the heater — a sweater does fine.

Good timing for some 97's. Much of their stuff deals with vigor,
explosions, shouts, etc.* This speaks to me now, partially, because of how
I felt this morning. It's not an important story (skip it if you want), but
it's a decent case study, so I'll proceed.

For those who don't follow me on Strava
: I had an "angry" run this
morning. The first half was faster than my normal clip, but not fast enough
to do what I wanted. My shins hurt, felt sluggish, etc. Since I figured I
wouldn't rally for anything noteworthy, I thought I might call it off
altogether, go home, "rest up", etc. — bad mental bargaining. Then, I got
angry at myself: for folding, for indifference, for gritlessness. I ponied
up for the intended second half, went faster, and felt better.

Moral is not "to be angry", but to embrace "getting out on the line".
That's the sort of thing that's in "Won't Be Home".

Thoughts: This was one of the first 97's songs I got into. The big guitar
appeals. W.r.t. the intro story above, listen for contrast between Miller's
soft wordage (e.g. '*rattletrap tonight*' and '*gettin' smaller*') and
Bethea's overdriven licks.


The song in question (the '*very first song*') is from Hank Williams

The bridge is emphatic:




*I'm pulling off the road, I'm opening the doorI'm giving you the pavement,
I'm telling you what forYou're no more than a thoughtNo more than a thought*
*Ah you're getting smaller in my rear view mirror
*

And as you might expect, there's a good video on YouTube.*** Skip to 1:13
 if you don't care for cheesy intros.
Some of the highlights for me:

   - Bassist Murry Hammond hoisting his guitar at 1:42
   , in what I assume is a salute to
   Tom T. Hall (per #271).
   - Signature Miller elbow swings at 1:59
   .
   - Guy in the pink checkered shirt "dancing" at 3:09
   .
   - Powerstances from Miller and Hammond during the guitar solo at 3:20
   (which is the same stance I take
   when I have to write low on a chalkboard).

Bring that energy into your week.

Song #351: "Goddamn Lonely Love"


Who Made it: Drive-By Truckers

Year: 2008

_______________________________

Thoughts: Huge fan of the various sounds in the intro. Layered hums and
buzzes, organs and bells, then guitars each way. The sleepy drums work
wonders.


It makes a heavy solo .


Not the first (or last) to swirl heartbreak and drink together, but this
one's extra potent:





*And I could find another dream, One that keeps me warm and clean But I
ain't dreamin' anymore, I'm waking up. So I'll take two of what you're
having*


*And I'll take everything you got To kill this goddamn lonely*

*Goddamn lonely love. *

can be drowned if you hold it under long enough, but it takes a lot of
other things with it."

 Good work with the foolin', @KD. Well honed stylistic mimicry, except that
I'd never use a word with as many syllables as "apotheosis".

Gonna put it on record that Limp Bizkit made an F&L appearance *before *today's
rogue installment. Perceptive readers will remember this line from
"Placemat Blues" (#23):

I know what you say, you say you serve the youth

You serve them Bizkits and Korn with a spoon

But I think you just serve you

Song #327: "Houston"


Who Made it: Robert Ellis

Year: 2014

_______________________________

Thoughts: Many songs thus far have name-dropped Space City, but this is the
only one that brings it to the title. I started listening to "Houston" *before
*I moved here. It was a good, partially-filled canvas for preemptive
nostalgia.


I haven't listened to it much *since *I moved here. It's easier to map
yourself onto somebody else when they sing about somewhere you don't know
yet. It's more of a "leaving" song than "being", more '*reminding*' than
"forming". It might give me trouble down the line.


No claims of growth.

 Another one from Emmylou and Willie. Here they are with Joan Baez:

Not sure what they're singing, but it looks like they're having fun.

Song #289: "Gulf Coast Highway"


Who Made it: Emmylou Harris (and Willie Nelson)

Year: 1990

_______________________________

Thoughts: Nanci Griffith did it first. Click here

for her original, and here  to
see it with Darius Rucker.*

Per verse three, the highway in question is U.S. 90. It mostly runs
parallel to I-10 between Houston and Lafayette, then splits off south to
hug the coast while I-10 veers to Baton Rouge. They meet again in New
Orleans. That's the pattern, more or less, through Mississippi, Alabama,
and Florida, until the terminus in Jacksonville.

Moving westward, it goes through San Antonio to Marfa
,** then ends in Van Horn
.***

Willie's verse is my favorite:

*She walked through springtime*
*When I was home*


*The days were sweetThe nights were warmThe seasons change*
*The jobs would come*
*The flowers fade*

*This old house felt so aloneWhen the work took me away*

Think about the last two lines and what they say for empathy.

 Administrative note: tomorrow is Day 300/Ash Wednesday. I'd intended a
long writeup and crucial song for the occasion, but timing hasn't gone my
way. It's a busy week, and I don't want to rush it. So, I think that's
going to get pushed down the line. Maybe spring break. Stay tuned. In the
meantime, Steve's back with a holiday tie-in.

Song #310: "How Lucky"


Who Made it: Kurt Vile/John Prine

Year: 2020

_______________________________

Thoughts: I settled on this after some roundabouts today. I was listening
to Nanci Griffith's *Other Voices, Other Rooms

*this morning, which is an album of covers. Listening to it — especially at
this point in the project — felt like a reunion, or a "who's who"
roll-call. You can peruse Wikipedia for the details, but here's a partial
list of who chipped in: Kate Wolf, TVZ, Bobby D, Prine, Dement, Jerry Jeff,
Emmylou, Chet Atkins, Guy Clark, John Hartford, Alison Krauss . . .


Do you feel close to these names yet? Any friendly fondness? I hope at
least a little.


It got me appreciating how strong the "cover culture" is in this niche. I
know it's not the only genre where people play each other's songs, but it
feels particularly earnest here — maybe from all those kitchen table
singalong videos. The "red-threading" I do is fun, but I think it also
shows how involved with each other these folks all were (and are).


Griffith, with Prine, does a cover

of "Speed of the Sound of Loneliness"
.
Vile also does "SoTSoL"
.
I picked "How Lucky" instead (and the duet instead of Prine's original
)
because I'm feeling more lucky than lonely today, and because singing with
friends is better than singing alone.


I *almost *saw KV in the spring of 2020. I bought two tickets and had them
pinned over my bed for a couple months in advance. Things happened as they
did, though, and the concert got canceled. KV and JP played some shows
together before that (when the world still ran), and there's footage
 of them singing "Lucky" a few
months before Prine died.

[image: KV_JP.jpg]
The best part of the video is watching them shake hands and smile at the
end. The point  must have meant a lot.

Vile, demonstrating impeccable taste, is also a Terry Allen fan. Read an
interview they did together here

.

[image: Screenshot 2025-03-15 213333.png]
(Via Vile's Instagram. Caption: *"**Cookin up nuggets with the Master,
Terry Allen."*)

Have they played together? Of course: here's
 "Loretta" (#17/18).*

caught the full MJL show  in
Santa Fe last month.

Song #274: "Raising Hell"


Who Made it: Lucero

Year: 2001

_______________________________

Thoughts: It's been a while since we heard from Lucero. And, sadly, this'll
probably be their last slot. We're to the point in the year where numbers
start to dwindle —bittersweet. Do them the honor of listening 10% louder
than you usually would.


I can't relate to *all *the mischief in "Raising Hell".* But, I am a '*little
brother...livin' down in Texas*', which grants analytical credibility. And
as usual, references to brothers and distant familial geography add hefty
associations. Toss on some rippin' steel and we've got ourselves a ringer.


I've made this point before, but it's worth reiterating: Ben Nichols (the
guy singing) isn't as old as he sounds (or wasn't in 2001). I can't find an
exact birthday, but he's pretty fresh-faced in this video
. It's notable, also, for the
"early 2000s" imagery, the acoustified riffs from the man on the floor, and
the careful distinction between '*hell*' (acceptable) and '*shit*'
(unacceptable) w.r.t. radio-friendliness.


Here's the pre-climax, marked by heavier drums and riffage:









*As for me, the same old shitIs pulling me on downNever been quite ableTo
pick myself up off the groundAlways got big plansBut they're always in the
worksAnd I swear they'd pay offIf my luck don't give out first*

And here's the climax, with more of the same (+extra pedal):






*Well here I am againDon't know if I'm rightBut I can tell you that I'm
havin' funSo I give it one more shotBecause this race here ain't quite
doneI hit the ground and run*

The standout line to me is '*don't know if I'm right*'. Ain't that how it
goes? Keep faith, though, and trust in motion. '*Decide which way*' within
reason.


–Matt


*Never been to Austin.

 Instructions: listen through once before you read the thoughts. Do what
you need to get your head right. An honest and unspoken goal this year has
been to get everyone to like this song as much as I do. Today's the day to

Song #314: "One Paper Kid"


Who Made it: Emmylou Harris

Year: 1978

_______________________________

Thoughts: There it is. The big "reveal".


I know at least one of you pulled some google tricks to find this song
before its time, and others might have come across it naturally. It's out
in the open now.


This is one I've built toward.*


Think back to May 9th, 2024. It was my birthday. Two things, among other
things, were on my mind: the analysis qual I'd take the next morning, and
the debut of my semi-planned, semi-relevant, country-adjacent newsletter.
I'd picked out a year's worth of songs, sketched a rough format, and
wrangled some subscribers. I knew which song would come first, but I didn't
have a title.


So, instead of memorizing Schwarz lemma
, I walked around campus to
brainstorm. I'd been collecting my picks in a playlist called
"Countr(ey)vangelism"**, but I didn't like the undertones. I wanted
something less punny, less preachy. I thought it'd make sense to work
backward from the material. I asked myself which song I most wanted to
share, and which line hit me hardest.


This is what we got.


*********************************


Why now? Why not the finale? Mainly, I guess, because it's better "in the
midst". It's not a closer — more on this below. I'd hate to risk undue
pretense, i.e. feigning final understanding. It'd be a little too cute to
put this at the end, to draw up the bow and leave with a wink.
Pragmatically, also, I've got some time this week — I'm *making *some time
this week — and I've got the urge to move.


Plenty of good songs left, but denouement approaches.


*********************************


The "thoughts" on "Kid" blend in with the preamble. The song is the project
is the artist is the story is the process and so forth.


Who could it be but Emmylou? Willie, sure, is *a *star, but he's not *our *
star.


Math fact: by my counting, Harris has featured on 25 out of our 314 songs
so far, for a whopping 8%. That's more than anyone else. Beyond standard
proportion, she leads on songs that make me want to *write*.


I was listening through her F&L chronology this morning (3-17), waxing
nostalgic. She brought back memories: looping "RotGA" while I moved
apartments in May, making faces at Black Hole to "Ashes By Now", driving
back from Lafayette (i.e. "Leaving Louisiana"), and packing for Christmas
with "The Boxer" in the background — all in the last ten months.


Maybe the biggest success of this playlist, for me, has been pinning down
moments like those — sampling a rich year. It makes my self more tangible.


*********************************


I went to Black Hole (my preferred coffee shop) this morning (3-17) to get
some notes started. I wrote a bunch there this summer, but I hadn't been
back in a while. The morning was cool enough that I could sit out on the
east-facing patio and catch the morning rays without baking.


Partial alignment here: no* Camels****, yes *coffee*, no *cold morning
winds*.


Truth be told, the shades

hid some redness. I think I'll miss the list. I've had daily chances to
share, to delve, to preach and praise. I've chafed, sometimes, at my
(wholly self-imposed) expectations, and often savored the habit.


It's been a foil: sometimes, the songs feel foreign. I wouldn't pick the
same set yesterday that I picked last year, nor tomorrow that I'd pick
today. This is good: to paraphrase something that Osman said to me on the
phone a few weeks ago, it'd be a failure if I ended the year exactly as
into "sad alt-country" as I'd been at the outset.


I'll clarify/justify, though, that I maintain full respect for these songs.
Very, very few "punts" have stemmed from indifference. When I've had time
and still gone short, it's more often been from *excess *of feeling than *lack
*of it
*. *


Expanding: think of an engine.^ If you want to understand it, you should
de-construct it, re-construct it, analyze and tinker. When I've been up for
the task, that's what I've done. But, if you want an engine to *work* for
you, you should leave it under the hood. You don't want to run it by hand.


So too here: picking-apart is good, but not every day. If I were an
unattached, impartial observer, maybe I'd have consistently delivered 500
word, standard-sized missives. There's no *heart *in that, though. I'm
subject to the same whims and humours that I try to hear, which makes for
slippery business.


Anyway, much to say. Time to get down to it.


*********************************

We can start with this: '*Tomorrow came too fast, but he didn't mind*'.

What's in not minding? A good bit of faith, I'd say: faith that there's good*
in *tomorrow, or *past *tomorrow, or *through *tomorrow. I'll recall
"rose-tinting" and "pedestal-ing" and excess rear-view fixation. An
unwelcome '*tomorrow*' says more about the twist of your neck than it does
about itself: too caught up behind to welcome what's next.

"Kid' goes both ways. The bridge remembers; the verses expect:





*The driver was drunk or he just didn't see^^The future was there it'll
happen to me And all the time that he'd wasted was his once again It never
takes too long to go where you've been*


Pair that last line with one from the first verse: '*It don't take no time
to get where I am*'. If you've paid attention, you might remember Guy Clark
saying something similarly structured on #280: '*half of gettin' there is
knowin' where I been before*'. Recall, also, that Emmylou sang on "Anyhow",
which came out two years before "Kid" — enough coincidence to send me
sleuthing.


Here's the red-thread. Emmylou didn't write "Kid". The man who did was
named Walter Martin Cowart.


How did Cowart's song come to Harris? Some guesswork here, but I'll present
the facts. During his time at SFASU  (Nacogdoches),
Rodney Crowell started a band (a "folk duo") with Cowart's younger brother.
Crowell describes Cowart as "a pot-smoking, Bob Dylan-quoting poet,
songwriter, and long-haul trucker and instant role-model" — thus
establishing the Cowart/Crowell connection.


What about Crowell/Harris? We've heard the results, but haven't gotten the
story. To my delight, I found that Skinny Dennis (see #104, #170) is the
missing link. Here ,
Crowell describes meeting Dennis in a Nashville bar in the early seventies:


*"One evening I was looking for an empty booth where I could enjoy my free
supper when I noticed a six-foot-seven, one-hundred-and-forty-pound
humanoid leaning on a cue next to the pool table. As I passed by, he hocked
up a giant loogie and spat it into my beer. 'You won’t be needing any of
this now, will ya?' Sneering, he grabbed the pitcher out of my hand and
started glugging. I was surprised to hear myself say 'I guess this means
we’re gonna be friends,' and even more so when 'Give me half of that
hamburger and we’ll see,' was his response."*


Through Dennis, Crowell met Clark and joined those famous singalongs
. And in an apartment he
shared with Dennis, Crowell held meetings that eventually got his "Bluebird
Wine"

demo into Harris's hands. It wound up as the opening track on her second
album

When Dennis died, Crowell was a pallbearer at his funeral. I couldn't find
any pictures of Crowell and Dennis together, but here's a suitable stand-in.

In summary: the same very tall man who brought about my favorite bar also
brought about my (maybe) favorite song.


How's that for a '*crop of kismet'*?


*********************************


Onto the bridge that says it all:





*Broken hearts scattered all over the past Old bad memories tryin' to last
Whiskey and women and growin' up fast Fussin' and lovin' and itchin' like
grass*


Auditory appreciation: do you *hear it*? do you *get it*? Harris and
Nelson reach duet perfection. The full '*mem-oh-ries*', the hiss of '
*whiskey*', the pain in '*fast*' — every inflection is precious.

And the last, titular triptych: there's your third pillar. *Itchin' like
grass*. Hear how Emmylou says it, and how the backing swells? Don't you
feel brave? It's most of what I've been, and that makes me glad. I avoided
naming it (for the sake of mild suspense), but I didn't ignore it. Flip
(metaphorically) through the archive, and you'll find it throughout.
Any yearning, any vigor, any urge to sing or shout or sprint, to move along
and up — to me, that's *itchin'*.

*********************************

Now about *the kid*. The impression I get is somewhere between "folk hero"
and "plain folk". More than outlaw grit or noble distance, I hear ordinary,
hopeful goodness. The bridge — phenomenal as it is — describes
*anyone*. *Broken
hearts*? *Bad memories*? We've all got 'em. And it may not be *whiskey*,
but we've got some crutch.

Every song I've picked this year fits in those lines. By extension,
everything I've done this year (read: every year) fits in those lines.
They're ever relevant: not necessarily in an acute, poignant way, but
always humming in the background.

They're good to hold close.

*********************************

Obviously, "personal significance" is the main factor in what songs made
the cut this year and which ones didn't. I started listening to "Kid" in
earnest in summer 2022, which was not my finest hour — a source of some of
those '*old bad memories*'.

I was in Maine, post second year of teaching, pre (unplanned and unwanted)
third year. The summer was particularly rough: fair to say that it stunk,
and that I was itching (ha) to get out.

Silver lining: I moved into my first (and so far only) solo apartment that
year. I had more room than I knew what to do with, so converted the second
bedroom into my "sanctuary". I put all my best stuff in there: art, books,
records, pictures. And when I needed to escape the headaches of
life-out-of-line, that's where I'd go. Here's the panorama:

[image: Chill_Room_Pano.jpg]


I'd spin *Quarter Moon in a Ten Cent Town

*whenever I got the chance — mostly to hear "Kid". It was self-indulgent: I
liked to put myself in the song, identifying with the hazily-defined
protagonist.

Don't take that as self-aggrandizement, or as self-pity: as said above, the
'*kid*' is pretty standard, and the bridge is universal. Still, it felt
good to hear someone take such normal things  — lonesomeness, lost time,
lost love  — and make them sound so pretty.  When you don't like your
situation, and you're *feelin' unfeelin'*
,
the chorus stands out:



*The one paper kid wasn't really so mean Just a little bit scared and a
little bit green And he'd heard of a place where it's legal to dream... *

I was giving that last line the ol' logical work-over on my run this
morning (3-19). To wit: where *isn't* it *legal*? I figure that if you '*hear
of a place*' and believe it's real, then the dream's already there. No need
to recurse: to dream of a dream is still to dream, *n*-steps down the line.
In that sense, it's a sort of self-validating sentence: the only *illegal*
place is the one that's numb.

*********************************

Time to wrap up. Apart from this one, every writeup has been a single day
affair. Intentionally, that's never been enough time to "get it all out".
The philosophy is to take a "cross-section" and leave something left to
say. I decided to stretch this one out a little, but shouldn't push it.

Something obvious that's still worth saying: *rollin' *isn't a place. You
don't get there, pat yourself on the back, then stop. That's part of why
"Kid" isn't last: to leave some room for momentum, and to give the song a
future.

That's all. Hope you like it.

Write on some rocks.

Neither hold a candle.


PS2: You might've expected me to complain about the lack of pedal-steel.
And while I *do *think that a few bars from Kleinow or Maines or DeVito
would kick this into overdrive, I *trust *that it doesn't need it. Maybe,
even, it's better without. The song sounds like it's out there with the
*kid*, early in the morning or late in the evening, breathing the desert
dust. It's no honky-tonk, no dive-bar, no highway-fire. And if the
arrangement's to fit the scene, it ought to work *al fresco*. We get that:
one harmonica⁺, one guitar, two voices — grab a friend and send it up.

attempt to parse the details of what it means for the '*kid*', but you
might like to sit with the narratorial possibilities.

Song #320: "Pretend I Never Happened"


Who Made it: Willie Nelson

Year: 1974

_______________________________

Thoughts: Judicious steel usage. Groove-ish. Richly layered.


Preemptively reminiscent of *Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind*
.


Better than Waylon's


 Couple bits of miscellany to start us off. First, I've been digging *Just
About Due

*by Salt Creek. It's another Numero Group re-launch. Highlights include a Waits
cover,

a Marshall Tucker cover
,
and a drunk song
.

Second bit: Isbell has another (i.e. in addition to "Outfit") advice song
on his new album. Excerpt from "Don't Be Tough"
:




*Don't be shitty to the waiterHe's had a harder day than youDon't make
babies stay up laterJust because they're so damn cute*




*Don't say love unless you mean itBut don't say sorry 'less you're
wrongTell a story like you've seen itTell yourself that you belong*

Lastly*, a potential HoP  reference in Prine's "Shop
Talk"
:




*I seen you in your pajamasDrinking coffee at the House of PiesYou was
flipping for the checkAnd talking like your tongue was paralyzed*

Song #336: "I'll be Here in the Morning"


Who Made it: Townes Van Zandt

Year: 1969

_______________________________

Thoughts: Wowee. Less than a month out. Here's one about fighting your
roadsomeness.


Let's hear it for a micro-chorus:





*Close your eyesI'll be here in the morningClose your eyesI'll be here for
a while*


Connected memory: back in summer '23, I spent a few days bumming on
Moosilauke before I drove back to Wyoming and ended my seven year stint in
New England. I planned to stay out east long enough to catch high-ranking
list contributor Kevin D in one of his plays, but the travelin' jones got
me and I hit the road early.


I (regretfully) told Kevin I'd miss it, and he (gracefully) absolved my
sins. He blessed my trek with this:



*No prettier sight than looking backOn a town you left behind *

That, in turn, makes me think of a picture I took of Laramie out the back
window of my parents' Pilot in August '16 (en route to college). I can't
find it on Google photos, but I can see it in my head*.*

*Et toi?*

Song #280: "Anyhow, I Love You"


Who Made it: Guy Clark

Year: 1976

_______________________________

Thoughts: Coincidentally, one month since the last Clark song, which was
"Dublin Blues". As a little callback (and to supplement LJ's lackluster
YouTube linking on #268), here's
 Luke Bell on a "DB" duet.


****************************


More preliminaries: cast of characters. Guy Clark, obviously, is the main
voice. Equally obviously, Emmylou Harris is the *other *main voice (for her
second day in a row). As we had with Neil Young, here's a "Grandpa's
Facebook"-style picture of the pair:


[image: GC_EH.jpg]

I've said plenty about Guy and Emmylou. There'll be more. But, I should
also clear the air: longtime readers will remember me writing some
unflattering things about Rodney Crowell. To be explicit (lest I snub*),
Crowell is the third voice you hear for most of the song — and he does a *great
*job. I've come full circle on Rod. He's an underdog. Plucky. Good writer.
Nice head of hair.


[image: RC_GC.jpg]
(Rod and Guy)


On "Anyhow", though, Rod draws the short straw. He's sharing vocal space
with some heavy hitters. He holds his own up until the three minute mark,
but when bigshot Waylon joins in, Rod fades out. And since the ending's so
*memorable*, I usually forget who did the legwork for the first three
quarters — *mia culpa*, Rod.


Be better than me. Give the man his due.*


****************************


Headspace recommendation: we're neck deep in the week. Afford yourself some
romance. Put someone in mind. If you have to, pretend. Recall Guy and
Susanna. Watch the documentary
,
or look at this picture:


[image: GC_SC.jpg]

If you're still cynical, watch this
 — tender as it gets.

****************************


Now, loudly: there is no part of this song that I don't love. If all you
did were to read the title and listen through the first lines, that'd be
plenty:




*I wish I had a dimeFor every bad timeBut the bad times always seem to keep
the change*


Hall of fame opening. *Bad times always seem to keep the change*? Come on.
Then, it gets better: the chorus, the rhythm, the swell — months of verve
in a twenty second span:


*Just you wait until tomorrow *
*When you wake up with me *
*At your side and find *
*I haven't lied about nothin'.*

*And I wouldn't trade a tree*
*For the way I feel*
* About you in the mornin'*
*Anyhow, I love you.*

Hear how the '*just you...*' dawdles slightly, then the ball gets rolling?
Guy counts 'em in. It's all so confident, so sure, that you wonder if it's
a bluff. Who, after all, *hasn't lied about nothin'*?

Bluff or not, I trust the foundation — any fib is surface deep. The *feeling
*is right, all through to *mornin'*.

Then there's the last line. The wallop. Practically, what's with the '
*anyhow*'?

I say another reversal, like adverbs or gruffness. Not to dismiss, but to
allow, to ease. Again, to get the ball rolling. This goes back to what was
happening on "Dublin Blues", so I'll repeat what I wrote (and foreshadowed)
there: *Clark knows how to say it*. If he needs the *anyhow*  — a sheen of
nonchalance, a stutter, a tic — so be it. This is not mundane; this is not
easy. It also goes back to "The Promise" (#142), w.r.t. "heavy words"
bouncing and looking for cracks.

Better to walk with a crutch.**

Clock's at 10:45. This is also important:



*Everyday it getsJust a little bit betterAnd half of gettin' there is
knowin' where I been before*

That last line'll come up again on big #300, along with some sort of reveal.

****************************

Now, about the ending: with fifty seconds left, the
song-that-keeps-on-giving busts out a *fourth* voice. A *famous *voice. I
bet there's a good story out there about how Jennings wound up on the
track. As it is, without overshadowing what's already in place, he adds
enough *oomph *to bring it home big.


Time's up. Enjoy your Fridays.


–Matt


PS/YouTube Interlude: here's the video
 to watch. À la "Lover's
Lullaby", it's a pared down, age-advanced, heart-touching rendition. Don't
be angry with the lady who yells "thank you" over the opening lines — she's
happy. I think it's a nice side-effect of the lowish quality recording that
the two guitars merge into one uber-sound, which makes it seem like
Guy has *really
*been practicing. And, he's *funny* — note the delivery on '*nothin'*' and '
*don't*'. ***

Song #281: "In Spite of Ourselves"


Who Made it: John Prine/Iris DeMent

Year: 1999

_______________________________

Thoughts: Maybe folks saw this coming: JP's turning into Mr. Holiday. This
is another one from Uncle Joe's early 2000s Christmas mix. I was maybe
eight or nine when we got it, which means I must have glossed over the risqué
bits for a few years.*


Osman primed us for DeMent's feature. This is a notably brighter song than
"Our Town" (#160) or "Easy's Gettin' Harder Every Day" (#250). To repeat a
universal opinion, she's the right choice. List-favorite-Harris would
sometimes  play it live with
Prine, but the '*brass monkey*' line didn't sound right.


Probably the best thing to do with this one is to Mad-libs it: make your
own list of endearing oddities, and sing your own song — printable template
attached.


Anyway, this is more of a sunny mid-day tune than a late-night burner, so I
thought I'd get it out early. More time to do the Mad-libs, and more time
to '*sit on rainbows*'.


Take care of your noses.

Song #298: "Dreadful Selfish Crime"


Who Made it: Robert Earl Keen

Year: 1994

_______________________________

Thoughts: "DSC" is the closer from Keen's *Gringo Honeymoon
*.
Note the date: 1994. At the time, Keen wouldn't have yet been forty, and he
was only on his fourth studio album (out of more than a dozen now). Some
precious time remained (and remains). Still, can't fault him for feeling
washed up — it's natural.


Here's young Keen (right) in his A&M days (but not with Lyle Lovett):


[image: YoungREK.jpg]

Part of the illusion (of washed-up-edness) must come from noticing that all
the good times we know *have *already happened. They fill the stretch of
"everything so far", which feels like *all of it *because it has been (and
is). The times yet-to-come don't mean much yet.

Primary source: here's a text about "Dreadful" that I sent to
subscriber/contributor/on-hiatus-bandmate Nick last year when I was feeling
down about my situation:

[image: DSC_text.jpg]



I stand by what I said, but acknowledge much 'precious time' between then
and now.


–Matt


PS: Decide amongst yourselves if this verse is '*precious*' or a robbing or
both:






*Had my first gig here in the neighborhoodWe had a little band I thought
was goodHocked my old shotgun bought a used P.AWe got a quart of rum drank
it all that dayWhen the big gig come we were just too drunk to play *

"listing nouns to build a vibe" hall-of-fame:



*Smell of coffee, eggs, and bacon... *


*Set of keys and a dusty suitcase... *


*Cotton fields stretching miles and miles... *


*Telephone poles, trees, and wires fly on by... *


*Broken down shacks engine parts... *


*Little bit of dirt mixed with tearsCar wheels on a gravel road*

'*Little bit of dirt mixed with tears*' would make a good tagline for the
gloomier side of the genre.

The other line I like: '*could tell a lie but my heart would know*'.

Song #348: "Timebomb"


Who Made it: Old 97's

Year: 1997

_______________________________

Thoughts: Just like me frfr.


Opening riff gets the people going.


Adieu, 97's. On your terms.

Song #331: "Excuse Me While I Break My Own Heart Tonight"


Who Made it: Whiskeytown

Year: 1997

_______________________________

Thoughts: Refer to deputy LJ's take on "16 Days" (#219) for a well-phrased
and important disclaimer w.r.t. Ryan Adams being an asshole. He's not the
only one in Whiskeytown, though, and this song needs its spot.


Blast this the next time you hit a *situation*
:


*Well, excuse me if I break my own heart tonight*

*Some things are born too strong, have to learn how to fight*

*The situation keeps me drinkin' every goddamn day and night*

*Situation don't seem so right*


Pedal goes crazy, too.

Song #275: "Love Like This"


Who Made it: Drive-By Truckers

Year: 1999

_______________________________

Thoughts: Calendar savvy F&Lers will note the holiday on Friday.
Anticipating this, back at the start of the year, I slated a set of
heart-centric songs to fill the next seven days. Whether or not I proceed
with the lineup is TBD — I might opt to spread them out over the remaining
weeks if the spirit demands it. But, for now, I'll follow the plan.


Day one goes back to DBT. Album #2: *Pizza Deliverance
*.
This one's coarse in its language, coarse in its fineness. "LLT" doesn't
shy away from the dirt and the blood of figuring out what's what. No bows;
no nonsense; no ease. You can feel the floorboards and blisters:







*Last night I slept with my boots on again, One cut on my forehead and one
my chin, On the hard old floor with nothin' to cover up with. You got me
real good, girl, and I must admit, You pack purty mean punch for such a
pretty little dish.* And it's a shame to know most folks don't ever know
love like this.*


I sleep in a bed these days, but — lord knows — I've had my share of '*hard
old floors*'. Likewise, '*boots*' are staples. There's a cut on my chin
today, but just because I switched razors. The rest is beyond. Hard nights
need nonesuch floors, nor stings need cuts. '*Shame*' is its own beast. The
grit matters; the scene doesn't. Maintain some bile and fluster the
big-wigs:


*Come Monday morning*


*I'll be sore to a fare-thee-well. Cussin' God and America*

*Beggin' them both just to send me off to hell.*


'*God and America*' indeed. Listen to '*hell*' on this one
.

In the end, '*got*'' is plenty, and the bass lands when it ought to. Spare
the dobro and splurge on banjo. The steel takes a full four minutes to kick
in, then precedes *sweet love.*

That's *real good.*


–Matt


*Official lyric from the DBT website

Song #292: "Do I Ever Cross Your Mind"


Who Made it: Chet Atkins/Dolly Parton

Year: 1976

_______________________________

Thoughts: Yesterday's is a tough one to follow. I can't match the power of
UNFAK, but this is a nice tune.


Two (sort of) new names: Dolly's come up in reference to Trio
,
but Chet (aka "Mr. Guitar") is a first-timer. Here's a sampling of his
finest album art:


[image: Screenshot 2025-02-25 220002.png]

This one also comes with some F&L-relevant interpretations: Justin Townes
Earle/Dawn Landes

and Emmylou/Linda/Dolly
.
Common to all of them is the thumb-thumping rhythm and sweet
over/undertones. The Trio take is the most wistful, due partially to
Emmylou's bonus verse*:




*Do you ever wake up lonelyIn the middle of the night'Cause you miss me*


*Do you darlin'Oh and do your memories ever take you*

*Back into another place and time*


It's interesting to me that none of them made it bitter. The two duets are
playful — even giggly — despite thematic roughness. They yearn and wonder,
but don't bemoan the bygones.


Is that a lesson?


–Matt


*Which isn't really a bonus verse, because it's in the Parton solo-take
,
which preceded the Trio version.

Song #282: "L.A. County"


Who Made it: Lyle Lovett

Year: 1987

_______________________________

Thoughts: Filling in a newsletter gap here. Lovett is another Houstonian,
another (sort of) Clark protege — hear him tell the story in the intro to
this  cover of "Anyhow" at
Clark's 70th birthday concert. He was also Robert Earl Keene's roommate in
college, as explained in "The Front Porch Song" (#226). And, he makes an
appearance in *Walk Hard 
*alongside
Jackson Browne (and Jewel, and Ghostface Killah*).


This one sounds happy, but the plot is pretty grim. Listen for a familiar
voice at 2:33.

–Matt


*Providing a memorable entry  in the
"lyrics you wouldn't think exist but do" book.

Addendum: "Dancing in the Club" got the MJL studio treatment. Single

came out this morning. Less beefy than the live one, but it saves a trip to
YouTube.

 As promised, we'll start with notes from the show — and not just mine ! In
an F&L first, there'll be *dual *authorship on today's report.
Subscriber/IRL friend Olivia came with me last night. With only minor
prompting, she agreed to contribute her own dispatch, which follows below.


*_____________________________ *
*Concert Notes Part 1: Olivia*

Last night I went to Lenderman with Lead Author. It turns out MJ is a
popular artist, we weren’t even the only attendees from our humble Math
Department. LA wanted to arrive at 7:30 (the doors opened at 7 and the show
started at 8), but I thought that that would be ridiculous so we got there
at 8 (still too early imo). The opener was, fine. To quote LA, “All the
songs sounded the same.” Thanks to all the references to Lenderman that
appear in this newsletter (but never as the featured song in my
subscription tenure because of obscure rules about “what counts as
country”) I was able to sufficiently prepare. Overall a great performance;
it was cool to see his embodied voice, there were lots of great guitar
licks, they burn incense and drink what I can only assume is tea on stage.
One song that got me that I hadn’t heard previously was “No Mercy”

:

*To say that I love you*
*Is more than the truth *

*It is thе drywall under my roof . . . *

*If we meet up *
*In the next land *
*I will be your enemy . . . *
*I will give you my pain*

The screaming/singing really is even more effective live.

–Olivia


*_____________________________ *
*Concert Notes Part 2: Matt*

For the record, 7:30 was my walked-back offer. 7:15 was what I had in my
head, but I didn't want to sound "ridiculous" — so much for that. Also, I
prefer to think of my rules as *nuanced* rather than *obscure*.

On that note, let's get the bad news out of the way. Our guy Xandy Chelmis
 caught a debilitating case
of food poisoning and had to skip the show. He came out to set up, sat for
a while, then beat a hasty retreat. That meant no pedal steel and no fiddle
— no clarinet either, but we can't pin that on Xandy.

The rest of The Wind did a strong job of picking up the slack. The result
was something less countrified than I'd expected, but still really, really,
(really) good. It was lean, loud, and gazey. Feedback abounded. I think
they played everything off *Manning Fireworks *(including the title track
as opener), four from* Boat Songs*, one from *GOYGS*, all of *Lucky*, and a
few others.

Some of my favorites: "Basketball #2"

was one I didn't get into until the last week or two before the show, but
was in my top three of the night. It came out in 2019. Since Lenderman was
born in '99 (Feb 4, actually), he must've been about 20 at the time of
recording. That was prime-time for me w.r.t. feeling glum in silly
situations at parties and w.r.t. drinking game prowess, which makes this
pair of lines eerily resonant:**


*Embarrassed to feel blueIn my Halloween muscle suit . . .*



*There is nothin' worseThan dancing when you don't wannaSo I try to stay
busy *
*Winning at beer pong*

Darkhorse of the night: they pulled out a cover of "Dancing in the Club"

by This is Lorelei

(who played with them earlier in the tour). I was skeptical when they
announced it — never heard of the band/was hoping for DBT — but they won me
over. It's in the content sweet spot of not *exactly* like something you'd
hear on *MF*, but close enough to sound *right***. Plus, it's got lyrics
that ought to appeal to our angsty Steely Dan contingent:***




*And I sang into my phoneI ate my dinner in the darkAnd I fucked up my
guitarWhile I was fucking up my heart*




*While I was singing Steely DanCrying "Shake it" in the windYeah, a loser
never winsAnd I'm a loser, always been*

Here's a pretty decent recording
 of MJ + Wind's version from a
recent show in Athens.

Lastly: due to further instances of the aforementioned food poisoning, the
crew *almost *didn't come back for an encore. They rallied, though, and
managed one more with gusto. "Knockin' "

was the closer. Like Deputy Author Olivia said w.r.t. "No Mercy", the live
screaming is something else. Unclear if DA could hear me belting the
*knockin'*s, but I was.

Song #335: "With Tomorrow"


Who Made it: Gene Clark

Year: 1971

_______________________________

Thoughts: Short little one. Obvious parallels to "Come Tomorrow" (#218).


This might just be an honest-to-goodness folk song, but Gene's been with us
for a while. It could be the last we hear from him. Fret not, though, for
he leaves in lyrical style:





*So if there someday won't be time just to look behindThere won't be
reasons, no descriptions for my place and mindThere was so much I was told
that was not realSo many things that I could not taste but I could feel *

Don't think we ever got a picture of him, either. Here's one* from the
later years:

[image: GC.jpg]


It's not too bad as a lullaby.** The '*owww*'s do the trick.

 I wore my Allen t-shirt to work today, so figured it'd be a good time to
roll out another song. As an appetizer, here's Terry in a good shirt:

Don't blame me for nightmares.

Song #302: "New Delhi Freight Train"


Who Made it: Terry Allen

Year: 1979

_______________________________

Thoughts: Plenty to like with this one. Apex train song. The runtime's a
little long, but it's worth a few listens to catch the details. Some of my
favorites:

   - The whistling harmonica.
   - The falsetto backing vocals on '*left my (love/life/guns) behind*'.
   - The vocal '*chicka-chicka*'s sprinkled throughout.
   - The high note at 3:57.

There's a funkier version

from Little Feat (who did #s 80 and 165). And there's a lively performance
 on YouTube. While you're
tubin', catch the mini-doc *on
the making of *Lubbock (on everything)* — worth it for the slideshow and a
good bunch of accents.

Here's a well-phrased verse:





*And I killed me a man named smilin' JeerdunYeah I killed him with one of
my gunsAnd I knew I had did what I had not ought toBut I welcomed the run
from what I'd done*


There's some wisdom wedged in there. If you don't like wisdom, just enjoy
the rhythm.

 Looping back to "Cadillac"

for a moment, which I plugged as a non-list pick ("honorable mention") a
couple days ago. I mentioned that I really liked the last line:



* It’s a good day at the wreck yard It’s a bad day for my heart *

It occurred to me that some of its resonance might come from similarity to
another (favorite) last line:


*Supposed to be a funeralIt's been a bad, bad day**

Great minds and all that.

Song #308: "That's How Strong My Love Is"


Who Made it: Steve Young

Year: 1969

_______________________________

Thoughts: Recall that this Steve (not that Steve
)
contributed #116. This one (#308) is not Steve's song. He wasn't the first

to record it, nor the most famous

(nor, honestly, the best). But, he did alright, and he was at Guy Clark's
1975 Christmas Party .


If nothing else, it's a good excuse to link the other versions. They'll all
get tossed on a playlist at some point.

Song #326: "TV Dinners"


Who Made it: MJ Lenderman

Year: 2021

_______________________________

Thoughts: This song is not just a banger, but a banger about being lonely.

Just as being lonely is defined by an absence of friends or company, it
fits that most of the song is about what the speaker *isn’t* doing. Not
fighting, not talking, not looking, not content, and not loving work. The
only things he *is* doing is being tired, lonesome, and working to provide.
There are also some could-do’s and would-do’s mostly wrt the secret third
person he aims to share in his loneliness with.

As far as TV dinners, there’s the pre-portioned individual frozen meals
(invented in the 50s), then there’s what I do most evenings: streaming the
latest cooking, running, SNL, or micro apartment content YouTube has to
offer on my propped up phone while I eat. As of today, I’m officially two
months into living alone for the first time in my life. It’s pretty
luxurious, there’s a freedom to not attending to or minding the needs of a
roommate. On the flip side, there has been a many-fold increase in my TV
dinner rate (second meaning). I heard on NPR the other morning that the US
dropped in happiness rankings again. One of the ways such a thing as
happiness is gauged is by asking if respondents had eaten every meal the
previous day alone (this has risen some ridiculous percent in the last
twenty years). To quote Jenny Lewis “to be lonely is a habit:”

TV dinners tend to compound through repetition.

Anyways, I’m eating dinner with some friends tonight, we’ve been making a
habit of it over the past couple of months. I hope this can be a
non-annoying admonition to break bread with someone this week.

Song #305: "Lilacs"


Who Made it: Waxahatchee

Year: 2020

_______________________________

Thoughts: Pretty good day on my end. I substituted for a class and got to
flex my ol' lecturin' legs. I won over a fan, who asked me what courses I
taught — he wanted to sign up. And, the weather here was right in the sweet
spot. Today's niceness prompted two bonus excursions: one midday walk to my
apartment (to fetch an "important" notebook), and one "day-off" run.** Both
made me happy.


So, maybe this email will make up for some of the whiny ones. Nice things
only. I'm sure Waxa-Katie crammed some subtleties and layered emotion into
"Lilacs", but I choose to take it (today) as a flat-out springtime
beamer.***


One of my favorite micro-seasons back in Laramie is the first week or two
of May when all the trees and bushes bloom. It smells good; it feels good;
it precedes my birthday and the end of the school year. It's late stage
track.


The tree I remember is crabapple; the bush is lilac. Lilac, as my dad often
reminds me, is his favorite smell. We've got a couple good bushes in our
backyard, out by the gate to the alley — fond whiffs in years gone by.


Anyway, trees in Houston don't wait til May to bloom. I can smell the
lilacs now. So, I'm rolling out the Waxa. Y'all can save it for later if
you want to, but I won't be.


Classic high-Lexile verse:





*When I live a sparse existence, I'll drop down in the foldLean into an
urgent falter, spin silence into goldI run it like the crop of kismet, I
run it like a dilettanteI run it like I'm happy, baby, like I got
everything I want*


The third line gets in my head: not to help me understand it, but to make
itself stick. '*Crop of kismet*'^ and '*dilettante*' are wonders.


Affirmation by negation: "I am not sparse."


–Matt


*I'm about 20 songs behind on updating the archive, but I'll get around to
that too.


**After mild prompting.


*** Not dumb. I see '*angry*' and '*awful*' and '*violent*', but I don't
want to talk about that. If KC's got a problem with my omissions, she can
take it up with me at the joint Waxa/Wilco concert in Houston on May 4th.


^Not to be confused with a crop of millet


 First off, thought I'd link to this video
 that went up on Guy Clark's
YouTube channel yesterday. It's a recording of him singing about Susanna at
UH back in 1970 —
no footage, but lots of good pictures.

Unbeknownst to me, his estate/record company released a whole album

of recordings from the show. Promising stuff. I'll listen soon.

Another album I've enjoyed recently: DBT's *Live at Plan 9
*.
It's got a heightened pedal-steal factor, courtesy of John Neff
. "Gravity's Gone"

is a highlight.

Song #342: "Me and Willie"


Who Made it: Emmylou Harris

Year: 2003

_______________________________

Thoughts: Contrary to what you might guess, this "Willie" is not *that
 *"Willie". You
can read an account here
 (from
someone who takes their research more seriously than I do) of how "M&W"
came to be.


In short: Emmylou didn't write it. I'm not sure, actually, how it got to
Harris, but Laurie Hyde Smith 
gets authorial credit. The article above is by a musician (Michaela Anne
)
who heard the song*, liked it, and tracked down its maker.


Here the two of them are:


[image: MW_Writer.jpg]
(Hyde Smith left, Anne right)

************************************


By my reckoning, "M&W" is tragically overlooked. It's a bonus track on the
2003 remaster of *Luxury Liner
*,
which — frustratingly — means it's missing from my physical copy. The 2003
release date makes it our most chronologically advanced Harris track. You
can hear the shift in her voice when she sings '*seven long years*', or '*never
understood*', or '*plans we made*'.


Harris would've been about 56 in '03, with 40 years of touring and
performing experience.** As should be obvious, that gives her delivery on
"M&W" some punch. She's got plenty enough history to light up this verse:





*Me and Willie, oh we watched a lot of dreams die youngPlans we made, how
quick they fade, fumblin' one by oneWillie never let it bother him and if
he did, well it didn't showYou know he had a way of lettin' go, making blue
turn gold*


Less so than being "not Willie",  it's also "not Gram" — not *just *Gram.***
With how densely Harris cuts through this scene, you can assume she knew
(and probably worked with) most of alt-country's "die-young dreamers" from
'67 to now.

They're all in Willie.

Food for thought: How does it feel to sing about what might have been when
it was what was?

–Matt


PS: Unclear whether this is Marietta
, Marietta
, Marietta
, Marietta
, or Marietta
. Whichever it is, the last
verse reminds me of "The Last Time I Saw Richard"
.


*Anne has her own cover
.


**40 > 7


***We'll get to his song later. "M&W" does make me think of "My Man"
,
though,which *is *a Parsons tribute:





*I once knew a man, very talented guyHe'd sing for the people, and people
would cryThey knew that his song came from deep down insideYou could hear
it in his voice and see it in his eyes*

Song #346: "To Live Is To Fly"


Who Made it: Townes Van Zandt

Year: 1971

_______________________________

Thoughts: Would that I had more time. It's solid-gold hits from here on
out. Maybe next week I can shirk some job duties to bring us home in style,
but for now I'll take what I get.


This is our only two-timer. I sent out the Junkies cover

(#251) back in January, but didn't feel much like writing on that
particular day. Instead, I advertised TVZ (*down the line*) and made a
claim:


*"I don't think that ruining the surprise will make the second coming of
"To Live Is To Fly" any less special. If anything, maybe you'll have your
own connection to the song by then, which will make my two cents all the
more hefty."*


*************************************


Time to see if the "maybe" holds water.


If I hadn't felt like *Junkin'*, I could have called on Steve
,
or Guy and Emmylou
*,
or even The Dude

to introduce it. They hold it close and put it out  — damn near
scripturally.


This I believe: no other song on this list packs a lyrical punch like
"TLITF". I'll suffer restraint and limit transcription, but ask you to read
it all.** These are lines that you should write down on note cards and
leave lying around your room, or in your desk drawer, or taped to the wall.


To quote Clark, "these are words to live by, friends":





*Days up and down they comeLike rain on a conga drumForget most, remember
someBut don't turn none away.*


If I had my way — which I might — I'd paint '*don't turn none away*' on my
ceiling. If I went blind to that, I'd jab it into my skin. Say it every
morning; work it into action. To me, it's the practical core of *living
well*. It's hard and worthy.


The paradoxes in the next stanza find most of what's frustrating and all of
what's worthwhile:





*Everything is not enoughAnd nothin' is too much to bear.Where you been is
good and goneAll you keep is the getting there.****


Here's a fact: if I could pick one fine and helpful thing to come from
cobbling this list together, it'd be to deliver "TLITF" to someone who
could use it. Or, just to put it in their pocket, in case they need it
later. Because since I first heard it — sunk in my gut on a lonely Maine
night — it's always been a comfort:



*Think of all the poetryAnd the pickin' down the line *


And a signoff:



*Shake the dust off of your wingsAnd the tears out of your eyes.*

–Matt


*Bonus: Guy playing it live 
in Austin (with cheeks not dry). You can imagine who might've gone through
his head during '*goodbye to all my friends*'.


**The first four lines (the *babe*
 ones) are the only bit not up
to snuff.


***Compare the last couple lines to "OPK" (#314) and "Anyhow" (#280).

Song #277: "Long Long Time"


Who Made it: Linda Ronstadt

Year: 1970

_______________________________

Thoughts: A classic. We all know it. If you didn't know it before, you
heard it in *The Last of Us *.*
It's Ronstadt's fifth and the week's third. It puts the "and" in our name.


Gary White

wrote it. He was friends with JJ Walker. For some of the backstory, you can
watch this video , which
starts with a great quote:


*"It's like cowboys are just runnin' around with a gittar, gettin' stuck
somewheres, writin' a song about wantin' to be back when they get enough
money. And then they get some money, and they go get stuck somewheres else
again, and . . . pretty soon they have a career."*


The sound quality on the video is terrible, but it's worth a watch for the
Loyd Maines spotting. The hi-fi version
's
on Spotify.


For all his strumming, Walker can't hold a candle to Ronstadt. It's her
song, through and through. Listen to how she shifts her voice in the first
verse, changing perspective from "well-meant-advice" to "heart-in-the-midst
":








*Love will abideTake things in strideSounds like good adviceBut there's no
one at my side And time washes clean love's wounds unseenThat's what
someone told meBut I don't know what it means*

That's how it goes. Wisdom wilts in action. We get our own moments, which
we live first and last.  We can't neuter them, no matter how many
"there-there"'s we try. The rear view, clear and detached, loses scale.
Ronstadt gets it right by singing from the throes.

Speaking of "got right": the strings? The bass? Masterclasses.

The last '*everything I know*'? Godly.


–Matt


*According to Wikipedia, the song got a huge boost from the show:

Song #347: "Sharp Cutting Wings (Song to a Poet)"


Who Made it: Lucinda Williams

Year: 1980

_______________________________

Thoughts: Feeling profoundly happy about the wealth of nice things that
this song brought my way today. Earlier, I thought I'd write it up as a
romance: a sweet, enraptured ode. It may be that, and may be more — there's
room for angles.


I like a title that's not in the lyrics. It makes you wonder why. I've done
some digging on WIlliams over the course of the year, but never as much as
I should have. So, I'm flying (mostly) blind. But, I do know this: her dad —
Miller Williams — was a poet. Not just just a hobbyist, either: he read
 at (fellow Arkansan) Bill
Clinton's 1996 Inauguration.*


[image: Screenshot 2025-04-21 191730.png]
(Pictured here responding)


LW and MW were close. When Lucinda married her current husband (Tom Overby)
in 2009 (onstage, mid performance, at First Avenue
** in Minneapolis), Miller joined them to set
the tone with a poem
.
He explains that he picked the one he did because it's about Lucinda, and
because she (age seven) provided its last line (which you should read for
yourself). He also shares a quote (spoken to him by a famous mentor
) about poems, but that also
works for songs: "Every good poem begins as the poet's and ends as the
reader's".


You can watch him recite here ,
and the rest of the vows here .
***

**********************************


Miller died in 2015 — New Year's Day. Toward the end, he fought
Alzheimer's. Lucinda wrote "If My Love Could Kill"

about it:










* If my love could killI would kill thisI would kill thisSlayer of
wondersSlayer of wordsMurderer of poetsMurderer of songsWho robbed me of
your memoryWho robbed me of your time*


But before that, she (co)-wrote "Compassion"
,^
based off Miller's poem by the same name:








*Have compassion for everyone you meet, even if they don’t want it. What
seems conceit, bad manners, or cynicism is always a sign of things no ears
have heard, no eyes have seen. You do not know what wars are going on down
there where the spirit meets the bone
.
*


If you're not afraid of tearing up, you should watch this video

from Lucinda's Facebook page. Father reads his poem, and daughter sings her
song.


Per the caption, it was the last time they saw each other.


[image: MW_LW.jpg]


**********************************

I think "Song to a Poet" is one of Williams' best. It's a rare one that I
hear as sung *to me *(a.o.t. *by me*). I called it "sweet" above, but meant
that in an aching, close-knit way — the kind that makes you want to reach
through the speakers and give ol' Lu a hug:^^



*Every day I miss your smilin' faceNo one here can ever take your place *

*The sun can shine down, over my townBut it never shines in my days*

Potent, for sure, but let's not leave it there. Set your mind, tonight, on
*wings* and *ships *and *stars.*

–Matt


*Favorite question from MW's inaugural contribution:


*We mean to be the people we meant to be*

*To keep on going where we meant to go*

*But how do we fashion the future?*


****ICP  played a show there
the night before the wedding. For any Jugga-nos in the audience, refer to
this SNL skit  for some
(minimal) context.


***The best bit : "Asking that you be
no other than yourself, loving what I know of you, and trusting what I do
not yet know, in all the ways that life might find us."


Could just as well have quoted these lines from "Poet":


*I won't demand you*

*I try to understand youMy love is as free as a dove*


^Reminds me, in sentiment, of Prine's "Hello In There" (#333).


^^Then there's this line, which puts "Poet" in company with "American Pie"

(*and I know that you're in love with him...*) and "Basketball #2"

(*there is nothing worse...*) on the list of songs that transport me to
hollowed-out parties:



*But I'll just stand with this glass in my handFeelin' like nothin' even
matters*

F&L #345: A Farewell to Slob.

_____________________________

Song #345: "One Rung"


Who Made it: Slobberbone

Year: 1997

_______________________________

Thoughts: Writing now in a state of semi-uninhibitment. Use to be, we'd
have one or two S-O-C's every couple of weeks. Not so much since then. In
the gist of 71 (though not so pronounced), I'll loosen the filter and let
'er buck.


Slobberbone ought to get some respect from y'all. Ringing down their sixth
today — and, shame as it is, their last. All the others've been from *EYTWRWWT
,
*while this from *BC
*.



Ladders rise to prominence.


Treat yourself (via myself) to a micro-playlist. What can we tie to "Rung"?
The big ones (the real ones) as follows:

   - "3AM"
   
   (per ZB, per 20
   
   )
   - "TV-Ds"
   
   (per solace and tube)
   - "Simp(le) Man"
   
   (per intention and repeated mention)

All that to say that orbits intersect.

Furthering: YouTube niches. Search for "One Rung" and you turn up this
 and this
. The first is itself — Best
of Denton, frontman and strummer.* The second's a kindred spirit: a
project, a year, and its fit full of songs. I wouldn't call it good, but
neither, likely, would he mine. All the same, 15 (!) overlap, and more in
spirit — Bruce week, Browne Week, Prine Week, Zevon.

Have we love for an acousti-solo? Been a while since a loud one. We'll get
there, but not for now.**

It goes back to Flatness.***




*You spend your whole life waitin' for somethin' to changeSomethin' or
someone to come around and rearrangeYou spend your whole damn life tryin'
to climb just one rungWith nothin' to do if it doesn't come*

Harden not your hearts; ignore not your dreams; and say goodbye to the Bone.

–Matt


*Note that this Old Quarter is not that

Old Quarter, but is (modulo reopenings
).


**Just forever. Reference in retrospect.

Thoughts: I don't know how widely folks outside the "math grad

Contributor ODG pointed out to me that "Pecan Pie" would be a fitting pick,
and I agreed.


Jeff Tweedy likes to say that it's the "best song he ever wrote."
**


You can self-assess your mental slant by whether you hear "pie"
euphemistically or honestly.

*"Celebrate" is probably too strong. Maybe "acknowledge" is better.


**It's also my favorite flavor. HoP

 Writing from my (mostly) empty room on Bissonnet. I spent a good chunk of
the day packing odds and ends into the RAV to get ready for tomorrow's move to
a new apartment. I'll be a little farther north, and rolling solo.

The emptiness got me thinking back to last May, moving in, and writing the
first few entries in similarly unfurnished surroundings — goes by quick.

To misquote  PJ again: "Everything Has C
hanged; Absolutely Nothing's Changed".

********************************

Ronstadt's clocking out. She racked up a respectable nine features since
debuting at #10. Today's the biggest hit.

Like with Lucinda, it's a shame that it took me this long to do some proper
digging. And since I ought to rest up before tomorrow's labors, the digging
isn't all that proper. But, I did read a New Yorker interview,

which turned up some nuggets:

   - Linda loves Tiny Desk .
   - She made the best-selling non-English language album in American
   history (*Canciones de mi Padre
   *

   - Floats out a good Emmylou quote (from "Before Believing"
   )
   i.r.t. stardom's fickle favor:







*How would you feel if the worldWas falling apart around youPieces of the
sky were fallingIn your neighbor's yard but not on youWouldn't you feel
just a little bit funny*Think maybe there's something you ought to do *

   - Shouts-out McPhee  as a
   writer *par excellence*.
   - And summarizes her criteria in deciding what to record:


*"I just tried different songs that didn’t necessarily have anything to do
with each other, but which expressed a real urgent feeling that I just had
to express." *

All this makes me like her — more, even, than I already did.

Song #284: "Wait Up"


Who Made it: Uncle Tupelo

Year: 1992

_______________________________

Thoughts: Our fourth shortest yet. This is good, because I can put all the
lyrics down. Refer to them now and throughout:





*Are you surprised it's meHope I didn't wake anybodyHoney, please wait up
for meI miss you more than I need sleep*




*Guess I'll let you goEven though I don't want toHoney, please wait up for
meI need you and I can't keep up this speed*

****************************

I've listened to "Wait Up" every day since last Thursday. It joins the
ranks of "songs that came at the right time." The right time, for me, was
when "not wanting to leave" was thick in my mind. I heard it (loosely,
distracted) before *leaving*, then queued it up again after.

I was home; I was mulling. I had the legal pad out that I keep in my desk:
not for posterity, but for on-the-spot parsing. I tried some songs for help
— Lenderman, likely* — then came to "Wait Up". From the primary source,
here's my appraisal:

[image: WU_1.jpg]

The last words (forgive the handwriting) are "hit hard", which understate
the impact. This was the line that got me:

[image: WU_2.jpg]

The eyes welled up at that point. Felt like Tweedy had a bead on me— like
he'd been watching me struggle to tie my shoes (to buy an extra minute) and
written me back in time.

A few days later (i.e. now), I thought about '*guess*' — a small, surly
word. Something about it snagged me, reminding me of notes-gone-by. This
led to a quick ctrl + f in the archive, which led to "Come Tomorrow"

(#218). Recall the lines:




*I guess that no amount of lyingTo myself will stop the cryingI guess I
have to take things like they are *

It's strange that that's how it was.** Here's what I said then:

"I started this one early enough that most of today felt like "tomorrow".
Something woke me up at 4:30 (could be ____, could be ______ ) and kept me
too wired to get back to sleep. I grabbed my headphones and got down to
business. The early hours added perspective."

Stranger still: the same thing (the early wakeup) happened again today. I
played it coy then with "*c.b _____, c.b. ______*", but couldn't have
fooled anyone. The blanks then weren't *blank*, nor are they today. You and
I and Jeff all know the reason:

*I miss you more than I need sleep*.***

I'll point out that Tweedy's *barely* singing this song. It's near spoken
word. Some debate as to whether the encounter at hand is on the phone or in
person, but it feels *direct*. This is one where I firmly (mostly) take the
writer's perspective, speaking *from *me rather than *to *me.

Got about ten minutes left before I hit send. Much more I'd like to say,
but this'll have to do. Here's the last line:

*I need you and I can't keep up this speed*

The *speed* remains mysterious. There's another layer in '*wait up*' (as in
"stay awake") vs. '*wait up*' (as in "slow down"), but we'll leave it at
that.

Well worth the wait.

PS: The spaced-out slowdowns at 0:49, 1:37, and 1:46 are interesting. Watch
here  to see how he does it
with a pedal, and here 
for natural guitar. Here  it
is Covid style (with the same guitar from the first one).

 Before we get to the main thing, I'm gonna plug something Lender-verse
adjacent. "Cadillac"

by Colin Miller came out on Feb 24. I looped it for a while today. Miller
does drums for The Wind (MJL touring band).  Xandy Chelmis (also in The
Wind, and hopefully now recovered from his food poisoning) lays down a
strong pedal solo starting at 2:34. The music video
 has Landon George (Wind
bassist), who probably plays on the track — crew runs thick.

Springsteenisms throughout. Brutal lines in the chorus:







*In that blood-black tinted window Cadillac There goes all my hope for you
There goes all my hope for you In the blood-black tinted window Cadillac
It’s a good day at the wreck yard It’s a bad day for my heart *

Those last couple are how I want to write.

Song #306: "On Her Own"


Who Made it: Gene Clark

Year: 1967

_______________________________

Thoughts: Been a long time since we heard one from Gene. Not his most
countrified track, but I'll still count it. The guitar in the intro reminds
me of "Wait Up" (F&L #284). The chorus reminds me of "That's How I Got to
Memphis" (F&L #271):


*I don't know why I go to Frisco*

*It's got to be that girl that I'd like to find *


and the slow and brooding bridge reminds me of "Sister Golden Hair"
:


*Seven days a week I wake up and look out my window*
*Sometimes I feel so low I can hardly speak*
* But what words I hear when she told me how much she loved me*
*Draw back the shades I might as well sleep*


"SGH" was going to be a list pick, but I didn't get to it this summer. It's
such a summer-heavy song (in my mind) that I haven't wanted to tackle it
since, and may never get to it. But, I'll point out the line that comes to
mind, which is one of my all-time favorite openers:


*Well, I tried to make it Sunday*


*But I got so damn depressedThat I set my sights on Monday*

*And I got myself undressed*


Back to bed. Call off the day. Try again next time.


–Matt


*Also features a Halo gun, and a waffle towel that looks way too nice for
cleaning up floor spills.

 Came down with some sort of bug, so I'll try to get to bed early —
doctor's orders.

Despite that, it's been a bang-up day. I went to Cactus Music in
pursuit of *Live
and Loose
.*
It came out on vinyl as an RSD-
exclusive. I ended up
waiting in line for ~3 hours (and got a sunburn on one arm from facing east
by a southerly wall), then snagged their last copy.

And a pretty blue disc:

[image: 20250412_193721.jpg]


I gave myself a scare after I got home and went to play it. When I dropped
the needle, it sounded slow and sludgy, like "Chipmunks on 16 Speed"
. I thought they'd pressed it
wrong, but turns out I just had the rpms set to 33 when 45 was right —
crisis averted.*

Another cool thing: I saw Bun B  at
the shop. He was there shaking hands and chatting it up with the crowd. I
saw later on the Cactus-gram
 that he'd signed a
bunch of records.

be back in July).

Song #339: "Just Be Simple"


Who Made it: Songs: Ohia

Year: 2003

_______________________________

Thoughts: Timing with sad songs is hard. If I'm down in a deep sense, I
don't want to write about it: I can feel it or avoid it, but I can't muster
perspective. One-liners follow. Conversely, if I feel great, I don't want
to muddy it up with moans and groans. I'd rather ride high.


There's a sweet spot. Today's the right sort of day: recuperative. Not torn
up, not in the clouds. I couldn't have managed it last night — too recently
youthful, too recently active. But twelve hours past a bug is a good time
to sit. My nerves have enough padding to handle Molina.


Disclaimer for those feeling frayed: this song is bitterly, potently sad.
It goes beyond the usual devestations. I talked to Osman about some of the
Ohia/Magnolia projects a few weeks ago, and he (fittingly) likened them to
"Cognito-hazards" :


[image: image.png]

The hazard, here, is getting *really* down. I mean "eclipse". I mean
"dementors". I mean "numb ".


It's a strong piece. Save it for a day that'll fit it.


*****************************


Time to complicate '*simple*'. *A priori*, not a bad thing. Many have done
much with it. Consider the good: Prine's "Spanish Pipedream"

makes the basics sound nice.








*Blow up your TVThrow away your paperGo to the countryBuild you a homePlant
a little gardenEat a lot of peachesTry an' find Jesus on your own*


Likewise for Ricky Skaggs'* "A Simple Life"
.








*I live a simple life A good coat when the cold winds bite Leather boots
for my bare feet Now and then a steak to eat I pick with the boys on Friday
night So I live a simple life. *


I put those in the "happily simple" (simply happy?) bucket. There's a sense
of being in on the secret, transcending the machine, folk wisdom, etc. etc.
etc..


Tone down the contentment, though, and you get to "Simple Man"

**:





*Oh, take your time, don't live too fastTroubles will come and they will
passYou'll find a woman, yeah, and you'll find loveAnd don't forget son
there is someone up above*

Here, if not contentment, there's hope: that focus on a few basic goods
will ease an aching soul. It's less warm and folksy than Skaggs and Prine,
more stoic and hopeful. It's still on the good side.

Several steps lower, we get to "JBS":



*You'll never hear me talk aboutOne day getting outWhy put a new address *
*On the same old loneliness*

These words are not hopeful. "Despondent" fits. I don't take "simple" here
to have anything to do with enlightenment. It's an anesthetic. When life
hurts and you can't imagine improving it (by change of habit or address),
you might just want *less*.

"Simple" cuts out the volume. It opts for a mild sub-neutral over wild,
scathing swings. Hear how tired the last chorus is, how halting and dry.
It's like the dead-eyed stare after a long cry, when you haven't cheered up
but you've worn yourself out. No gas to burn and no road to take.

It's brutal.

*****************************

If the sound weren't enough, here's what he says:

*It's always had that ghost *

*Who always almost tells me the secretHow there's really no difference *

*In who he was onceAnd who he's become*



*I think he's been letting me winAnd I think he's doing it againThanks for
letting me win*

*And everything you hated me for*

*Honey there was so much moreI just didn't get busted *


Awful things: to feel that you're (secretly) worse than anyone knows; that,
even at your lowest, you've gotten away with something; that the years have
done no good — to quote Van Zandt, it's as '*low as low can be
*'.



I try to end on a high note, but "JBS" makes it tough. I'll point to
Molina's defiance, right before he winds down.



*I ain't looking for that easy way out *


A moment of strength amidst the downtroddence.


*****************************


Good news: this is the roughest song I can share. Only up from here.

PS: Some of the finest pedal work around. The leadup to the bass-drop is
*fantastic.*

Nick Lowe wound up pretty famous. Could '*living herself to death*' be an
early sign of his penchant for paradox


 As I expected yesterday, today wasn't the day to hunker down and write an
essay. I know I hyped up #300 as a "big reveal" of some sort or another,
but that'll come later.

One thing I will say to mark the occasion: 300 went *fast*. And even though
I haven't been as verbose recently as I was in days gone by, I'm still
enjoying this project. Particularly, I enjoy the guest features and
replies. I'll make a last call for submissions: whether you've been onboard
from day one or just joined recently, it's not too late to step up from
"subscriber" to "contributor" — claim your slice while you can.

And on a sappier note, it's been nice to have this platform on days when
I've needed a (semi-responsive) void in which to shout. "Shouting" has
looked different ways, but the "void" remains receptive.

Thanks for that.

Song #300: "Long Time Running"


Who Made it: The Tragically Hip

Year: 1991

_______________________________

Thoughts: Today's song isn't third-pillar material, but it's still special.
To quote frontman Gord Downie on a live cut
,
"This song is a love song...uh for...for uh someone who's naive and...and
knows it (hehe)."


If you've spent time in Canada, maybe you know The Hip .
If not, maybe not. I have one of their stickers

on my acoustic guitar case, which was given to me by my ex-roommates
Canadian ex-girlfriend. She heard me singing "Bobcaygeon"
*
and decided I deserved it.


Make sure to either listen to the live one I linked or watch this video
** to get a sense of the
unfiltered delivery. I gather that The Hip, and Downie in particular, were
intensely important for Canadians of their time. Their farewell concert
(broadcast globally) was a "you remember where you were when it happened"
level event.


Here's  the trailer for a
documentary about their last tour, which shares its name with today's song.


Some of my favorite guitar ever's on this one. Hear how *lustrous *it is in
the intro? The notes right after '*drive-in's rained out*' (0:47) are up
there with 2:34 in "Running on Empty"

on my list of best musical moments. The barely-there cymbals give just
enough edge to keep the intro tight, and the big drop at 1:29 is *well
worth the wait*.


I'll quote the bridge, just to get '*caribou*' in the word-cloud:






*Well, well, it's all the same mistakeDead to rights and wide awakeI'll
drop a caribouI'll tell on you, I'll tell on youTell on you *


Wide awake now, but off to sleep soon (maybe).


–Matt


*Almost warrants inclusion because it says "Willie Nelson" in the first
verse. Also calls the sky '*dull and hypothetical*', which is pretty
Waxahtachish.


**Favorite bit: '*weatherman*' at 1:18 

 Long time no Truckers. Fixing that now.

Hearkening back to how things used to run 'round here. Tonight, I ate my
beans, brewed a pot, and planted myself at my desk. I'll be here til it's
done.

Maybe you notice some not-so-deep cuts these days. That's intentional. I
figure the hits hit hardest when you've got some foundation. Instead of
starting at the top and working down, I've meant to "set the stage" for
prime enjoyment of the big ones. You know a bit about DBT/Isbell, so you
ought to better appreciate what they have to say.

Timing matters.

Song #328: "Outfit"


Who Made it: Drive-By Truckers

Year: 2003

_______________________________

Thoughts: Consider "advice songs". Consider familial care. Consider a song
that rolls them together and roughs it up — "Outfit"'s that.


Listen and muse. The first verse (after the preamble) is "Night Moves"

gone straight:





*Well, I used to go out in a Mustang, a 302 Mach One in greenMe and your
mama made you in the back, and I sold it to buy her a ringAnd I learned not
to say much of nothing, and I figured you already know But in case you
don't or maybe forgot, I'll lay it out real nice and slow *


The advice — the chorus — is mixed. The point isn't that it's good (though
most of it is), but that the '*old man*' puts it out there.


It's probably happened to you: someone tries to get through. Wisdom warps
through the years. You count the thought, if not the letter, and take some
part.


The old man shoots straight. I count fourteen lessons, put in plain
commands (do and don't). Such need not be so — folks say things their own
way.


For example: *my *old man sent me two poems in the past two months. The
second ("Our Real Work", Wendell Berry) came by email. It's short enough to
put here:


*It may be that when we no longer know what to do*




* we have come to our real work, and that when we no longer know which way
to go we have come to our real journey. The mind that is not baffled is not
employed. The impeded stream is the one that sings.*


The first ("Desiderata" ,
Max Enhrmann) was printed on the back of a note with my 1099-INT.

Closing quote:


*So don't let 'em take who you are boy, and don't try to be who you
ain'tAnd don't let me catch you in Kendale with a bucket of wealthy man's
paint*

The Kendale*** line makes me happy. Part admonishment, part genuine, part
joke. It's just the thing to cap off a heart-to-heart: not to downplay the
talk, but to ground it, and to confirm that what's good is still good —
listen for a pat on the back.

Song #291:* "Yeh Jo Halka Halka Suroor Hai"

*

Who Made it: *Ustad Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan*

Year: 1979

_______________________________

Thoughts:


"The violence of the ecstasy [of the Qawwali listener] depends on each
person's pain of separation from his homeland."

– Ustad Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan


This list's wheels are coming off. The Lead Author is emerging from a ditch
filled with old heroin-addicted pedal steel players and heading for the
torrid and blessed pothole-ridden highway of life. He's headed for them
thar hills, and ain't nobody cain't stop him. He told me himself for this
entry to "spread your wings and FLY", so it shall be so.

Trust in my respect for the readership and the great tradition of American
country that I would not introduce foreign music here if a case could not
be made for its inclusion. I have also made a little listening guide for
the uninitiated so if you feel as though you have zero interest, I have
done everything in my power to ease you in.

------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------

Here's the case for including *Yeh Jo Halka Halka Saroor Hai (This Is That
Light, Light Buzz) *in FnL, made briefly:

- a folk song from itinerants in the farmlands of a conservative,
militaristic country of hundreds of millions which defeated the Soviet
Union via funding the *Mujahideen*.
- performed by an unhealthy but virtuosic man who died young.
- concerns the joys and horrors of losing one's self in the bottle / a
woman.
- Is in the same tradition as music beloved by Woody Guthrie and Bob Dylan.
Wrote Guthrie in '42: *“Omar Khayyám *(Islamic mystic poet in the
Sufi-verse)* seems to have been sorta of a hillbilly hisself, because he
took the words right out of my mouth.” *Read here

 for more deets on that connection, and Guthrie's recording of Khayyam's
*Rubaiyat*
.
If it's good enough for him...
- Country music was a category dreamt up by marketers to differentiate
"hill-billy" from "race records" to segment rural poors. All is one, we are
all man, let your silly categories slough off you like acid rain.

------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------

So does the winding thread of Sufi music take us from Khayyam to Guthrie to
this tune by UNFAK, *Ustad* (Teacher) Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan. Jeff Buckley
described him thusly
: "Part
Buddha, part demon, part mad angel...his voice is velvet fire... I've seen
Nusrat and his party repeatedly melt New Yorkers into human beings..."
Other fans included Michael Jackson, Sting, Eddie Vedder
 (a
Nusrat-obsessive who saw him live multiple times any chance he could),
Brian Eno, Massive Attack, Martin Scorcese
, Peter Gabriel
 and U2, says the LA Times
.
Buckley even played a version

of* Suroor *live*, *if you want some quirked up white boy magic.

The Ustad came from a family that's been doing this sort of thing for a few
hundred years. It's annoying to introduce Khan as the paragon of the art
form, which he is, because he's deeply odd. Totally improvisational, able
to segue into Western pop, traditional classical, movie soundtracks
including *The Last Temptation of Christ. *He invented the category of
popular qawwali music, defined it till today, and all in the space of a few
decades. Highly recommend minute 9 to 12 on this track

to see what all he can do with his voice.

For more on Nusrat, a lovely interview with him

by Buckley, where they talk about their fathers' deaths and Nusrat
insists *Suroor
*is only metaphorically about alcohol, the real intoxication is love. Sure,
maybe.

A note before we go deeper. Qawwali music is trance music, and by that I
don't mean that ketamine-addict fare pumped out by anodic anodynics in
Infidel Europe. The idea is you let it wash over you and take you
elsewhere. Sufis believe music and dance are about the most reliable ways
to get somewhere close to God. I've seen some of the most tightly wound
conservative stick-in-the-mud uncles back home unravel for a Qawwali. If
they can do it, you can do it. Groove with it. Feel free to let your
attention go in and out, this isn't an exam. More on qawwali for a western
audience here .

On to the tune.
------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------
The full lyrics are below, but the main thing is getting buzzed off of a
woman's attention, or possibly actual liquor (due to a woman's attention).
Urdu songs never get too specific, so it's anyone's guess.

The first four minutes are poems around that sort of thing. If it's feeling
a little slow, don't fret, it'll get faster. Any time you hear *sharaab *he's
saying liquor.

We then arrive at the main verse. This is the core of the song, all the
improvisation, all the bits revolve around this, you gotta get comfy with
it for a while. They riff on it, doing some vocal tricks.

*This light, little buzz I got on - ye jo halka halka suroor hai*
*It's your looking at me’s fault - teri nazron ka qusoor hai*
*That's what taught me to drink - ke sharaab peena sikha diya*

There's a few other verses they also build improvisations around, namely
these:

Tera pyaar hai, mere zindagi
Your love is my life

and

Teri behki behki nigaah ne
Your wandering, intoxicated glances—

Mujhe ik sharaabi bana diya
Have turned me into a drunk.

Mere baad kisko satao gy?
Who are you going to torure after me?
You'll hear these quite a bit.

The song speeds up and slows down, hitting it's highest speed around
14mins. Quick changes in tempo keep you interested for the whole duration.
A good qawwal band can keep an audience interested for four or five hours.
A great band can do that and induce some out-of-body experiences along the
way.

Guthrie noted something important (*"[Khayyam] knew how to put down in a
very few words just what it takes for a day’s run."*) The paucity of words
that Sufi poetry (much more effectively in Urdu) allows is powerful for
conveying emotions, states of mind, vibes. Take this little bit around
*8:55,* translated directly with the word musth left in, meaning feisty or
crazy or lusty, depending on the context. You can lose pronouns, tenses,
is, was. Can just go straight for the jugular, nouns and adjectives, verbs
and adverbs.

Listen along.

*Saara jahan mast, **Jahaan ka nizaam mast*
Whole world *musth. *World's Order *musth*.

*Din mast raat mast sahar mast shaam mast*
Day *musth*, night *musth*, sunrise *musth*, sunset *musth*.

*Khum mast sheesha mast sabuu mast Jaam mast*
Goblet *musth*, glass *musth*, jug *musth*, cup *musth*.

And another example, this one with dropped pronouns, making it really
unclear whether we're talking God, a lost love, the narrator:

Paas rehta hai door rehta hai
Stays close but remains distant.

Koi dil mein zaroor rehta hai
But someone definitely resides in the heart.

Jab se dekha hai un ki aankhon ko
Ever since I have seen their (gender neutral but could be the same as
above) eyes—

Halka halka suroor rehta hai
That light, light buzz lingers

The song goes on, UNFAK alternating between love and horror, hatred of his
condition and love of his prison. A thousand synonyms for wiggling,
meandering, wavering abound. The words sound right in any language: leher,
tahel, behek, that nice bendy H in the middle.

The whole song is that shimmering heat mirage on a hot road, that light,
light buzz that persists after she's gone.

Around minute 13 they start to speed up further, and then they take us all
the way to the end, screaming my heart's gone, my heart's gone.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The song is idiosyncratic, the themes universal: guilt, love, the deep,
deep pleasure of self-annihilation when the right woman, (or the Lord,
depending who you ask) comes round.

This has been a challenging FnL, and I thank anyone who checked it out. A
final thought to leave you with.

For UNFAK, music was a pure attempt to cliff dive with an audience and take
them to ecstasy. To half-ass, to break with the past would be an insult to
his father, to his religion, to the Sufi saints, to God. His devotion to it
was complete. He spent every waking hour listening to or composing music
since he was a child. That's the bar, I say. Whenever I walk away from his
stuff and go back to something dripping with irony, with excuses, with
self-doubt, it turns my stomach. What's the point, if you're not emptying
the tank.

In any case, enjoy this video 
of Central Park going ape shit for Nusrat's 1993 concert. Listen to the
insane tablas from 4:43 on, it's unbelievable.

Some FnL cork-boarding: The *Natural-Born Killers OST *features a combo
track

by Cowboy Junkies and John Prine, as well as a UNFAK hit.


For those interested in more chill qawwali, a nice lo-fi chill Nusrat

from
Massive Attack, and a wonderful collaboration

with a Brian Eno protege.

*Full Lyrics with some time stamping below:*

Saaqi ki har nigah pe bal kha ke pii gaya
Every look from the cupbearer, I take a sway and drink.

Lehron se khelta hua lehra ke pii gaya
Played with the waves till I wavered about into a drink,

Ay Rehmat-e-tamaam! Meri har khata maaf!
Oh, complete mercy! Forgive all my sins!

Main inteha-e-shauq mein ghabra ke pii gaya
At the ends of passion, I freaked out and drank.

Mutribon ki nawaain aati hain
Melodies of musicians are heard.

Kis ke geysoo khulain hain saawan main
Whose tresses have opened in the monsoon?

Mehki mehki hawain aati hain
Fragrant breezes come.

Dar par tha chashm-e-yaar ki sheh paa ke pii gaya
At the door, her eyes approved, I drank.

Aao sehn-e-chaman main raqs karain
Come, let’s dance in the garden courtyard.

Saaz lai kar ghataain aati hain
Clouds bring along their melodies.

Dekh kar un ki aankhnion ko adam!
Oh Adam! Seeing their eyes—

Maikadon ko haya-ain aati hain
Even taverns feel shy.
------------------------------

Paas rehta hai door rehta hai
Stays close but remains distant.

Koi dil mein zaroor rehta hai
But someone definitely resides in the heart.

Jab se dekha hai un ki aankhon ko
Ever since I have seen their eyes—

Halka halka suroor rehta hai
That light, light buzz lingers
------------------------------

Aisay rehte hain wo mere dil main
They dwell in my heart like this—

Jaise zulmat mein noor rehta hai
Like light resides in darkness.

Ab adam ka ye haal hai har waqt
Now Adam is in such a state at all times—

Mast rehta hai choor rehta hai
He remains intoxicated, completely lost.
------------------------------

Ye Jo halka halka!
This light, light—

Ye Jo halka halka suroor hai
This subtle intoxication—

Ye teri nazar ka kusoor hai
It is the fault of your gaze.

Ke sharaab pina sikha diya
That it taught me to drink wine.

REPEATED MANY TIMES
------------------------------

Around MINUTE 8

Teray pyaar ne, teri chaah ne
Your love, your desire—

Teri behki behki nigaah ne
Your wandering, intoxicated glances—

Mujhe ik sharaabi bana diya
Have turned me into a drunkard.
------------------------------

Sharaab kaisi, khumaar kaisa
What is this wine, what is this intoxication?

Ye sab tumhaari nawaazishain hain
It is all your grace.

Pilaai hai kis nazar se tune
With what gaze have you made me drink—

Ke mujhko apni khabar nahi hai
That I have lost awareness of myself.
------------------------------

8:55

Musth can mean anything from horny to feisty to crazy.

*Saara jahan mast, **Jahaan ka nizaam mast*
Whole world *musth. *World's Order *musth*.

Din mast raat mast sahar mast shaam mast
Day musth, night musth, sunrise musth, sunset musth.

Khum mast sheesha mast sabuu mast Jaam mast
Goblet musth, glass musth, jug musth, cup musth.

Hai teri chashm-e-mast se har khaas-o-aam mast
Your MUSTH eyes got everyone rich and poor MUSTH.


------------------------------

Yun toh saaqi har tarha ki, tere mai-khaanay main hai
Oh cupbearer, every kind of wine is present in your tavern.

Wo bhi thori si, jo in aankhon k paimaanay main hai
But even more potent is what these eyes hold as their goblet.

Sab samajhta hun teri Ishwa-gari
I understand all your playful gestures.

Kaam karti hai nazaar naam hai paimaanay ka
It is the effect of your gaze, but it is named a goblet.

Saagar shikan hai Shaikh bala Nosh ki nazar
The gaze of the pious man is enough to shatter the goblet.

Sheeshay ko zair-e-daaman-e-rangeen chupa k laa
Hide the glass beneath the colorful robe and bring it.
------------------------------

Around MINUTE 10:50
Teray pyaar hai, mere zindagi
Your love is my life

Teri behki behki nigaah ne
Your wandering, intoxicated glances—

Mujhe ik sharaabi bana diya
Have turned me into a drunkard.
------------------------------

MINUTE 11

Naa Namaaz aati hai mujhko na wuzu aata hai
I don't know how to pray, don't know how to purify myself.

Sajda karleta hun jab saamnay tu aata hai
But I bow when you walk by.

Tera pyaar hai, buss mere zindagi

Your love is my life
------------------------------

MINUTE 11:40

Main Azal se banda-e-Ishq hun
I have been a servant of love since eternity.

Mujhe Zohd-o-Kufr ka ghum nahi
I don't worry about being an atheist or a believer.

Mere sar ko dar tera mil gaya
I can rest my head at your door.

Mujhe ab Talaash-e-Haram nahi
I don't need a sanctuary.
------------------------------

Meri bandagi hai wo bandagi
My servitude is that kind of servitude—

Jo ba-Qaid-e-Dair-o-Haram nahi
Which is not confined to temples or mosques.
------------------------------

Mera ik nazar tumhein dekhna
A single glance at you—

Ba-Khuda Namaaz se kam nahi
By God, is no less than prayer.

Tera pyaar hai, buss mere zindagi

Your love is my life
------------------------------

Qayamat main tera daagh-e-muhabbat le ke uthun ga
On Judgment Day, I will rise carrying the wound of your love.

Teri tasveer uss dam bhi uss kalejay say lagi hogee
Your picture’ll still be pressed against my heart

Tera pyaar hai, buss mere zindagi

Your love is my life

Meri zindagi, teri yaad hai, meri bandagi
My life is you remembering, my servitude.

Jo teri khushee, meri khushee,
Whatever’s your happiness, my happiness

Yeh meray junoon ka mojazza
Behold the miracle of my passion.

Jahaan apna sar ko jhukaadia, vahaan main nay Ka’abah banaa diya,
Wherever you bow your head down, I’ll build my Ka’abah

14min

Mere baad kisko satao gy?
Who are you going to torure after me?

Mujhe kis tarha se mitao gy?
How will you erase me?

Dil chalon say dil lagi achi nahin
it’s not good to fall in love with heart-trappers

Ronay vaalon say hansi hai achi nahin
it’s not good when criers laugh

Dil lagi dil lagi main dil gaya
Oh falling in love, in love, my heart’s gone

Mera dil gaya mera dil gaya mera dil gaya mera dil gaya mera dil gaya
My Heart’s gone My Heart’s gone My Heart’s gone

Khuda ke liya apni nazron ko roko varna mera dil gaya
For the Love of God, stop looking or my heart’s gone

Mere baad kisko satao gy?
Who are you going to torure after me?

Mujhe kis tarha se mitao gy?
How will you erase me?

Kahan ja kar teer chalao gy?
Where will you go to shoot your arrows?


…… last couple mins, you get the gist

Ye Jo Halka Halka Suroor Hai
This subtle intoxication—

Ye teri nazar ka Qusoor Hai
It is the fault of your gaze.

Ke sharaab peena sikha diya
That it taught me how to drink wine.
